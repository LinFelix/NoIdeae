There\nare also about 100 wounded.\"\nA Western diplomat said at least 18 refugees died and dozens\nmore were wounded.\nA local army spokesman, Dieudonne Kasereka, told Reuters\nthere had been clashes between soldiers and refugees armed with\nknives and machetes, but that he did not know if there were any\ndeaths.\nMore than 400,000 refugees have fled Congo's neighbour\nBurundi since violence
