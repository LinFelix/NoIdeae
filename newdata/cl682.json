President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday that the EU will press the US to abide by its commitments to the nuclear deal reached in 2015, Tehran Times daily reported.\n\n\"We expect the European Union to fully implement the nuclear deal, known as JCPOA, and press the US to be committed to its obligations to the deal, Rouhani said.\n\n\"Iran also expects the EU to send this strong message to the US administration),\" Rouhani said during a meeting with the visiting president of the Chamber of Representatives of Belgium, Siegfried Baracke.\n\nRouhani said that Iran has been committed to its obligations and this has been confirmed repeatedly by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN nuclear watchdog.\n\nIran is determined to use the post-JCPOA atmosphere and expand relations with European countries, especially Belgium, he added.\n\nBrussels attaches great importance to compliance with the JCPOA and seeks to expand relations with Tehran, Bracke said.\n\nAfter years of tension with the West, Iran struck a deal with the world powers of Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States plus Germany in July 2015, under which Iran agreed to limit its uranium-enrichment activities in return for the lifting of western and international sanctions.\n\nThe international agreement is facing a serious threat of collapse as tensions mounted between Washington and Tehran recently.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, who during his election campaign had called the Iranian nuclear deal a \"disaster\" and \"the worst deal ever negotiated,\" approved new sanctions on Tehran for its missile programme.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
