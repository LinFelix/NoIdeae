S&amp;P 500 utilities\nare up 12 percent.\nWhile the Fed's expected announcement of the trimming of its\nbalance sheet has been well telegraphed, investors will look for\nany Fed reveal on its preference for shorter- or longer-dated\nbonds when it reinvests a portion of its maturing assets.\nIf the focus is on the repurchase of short-term assets, that\nwould likely push the long end of the yield curve higher,\ndriving investors' attention also to shares of banks, which\nwould theoretically make more money with the help of higher net\ninterest margins, said Morganlander.\nBanks borrow money short term and lend it out longer term,\nso a steeper yield curve is seen as positive for their balance\nsheets.\nHowever, long-term yields in the U.S. are not immune to the\neffect of low-yielding bonds in other developed countries like\nGermany and Japan.\n\"The general tendency based on global rates will continue to\npressure the yield curve,\" Morganlander said.\n\nBROAD MARKET TO SHRUG\nWhile the Fed's quantitative easing program was a pillar of\nthe U.S. stock market's march from then-12-year lows on the S&amp;P\n500 in 2009 to current record-high levels, winding it down is\nnot expected to produce a major market reaction on the downside.\nThe U.S. central bank is expected to initially trim no more\nthan $10 billion per month from its $4.5 trillion portfolio,\nwith the cap rising each quarter for a year until it hits $50\nbillion monthly.\nThe slow and steady move would not turn the U.S. central\nbank into a seller. The Fed would allow assets to mature without\nreinvesting the totality of those maturing assets, which would\ntrim some $300 billion from the Fed's portfolio after the first\nyear according to analysts.\n\"It's going to be run-off, not outright sales, so that in\nand of itself is a very gradual process,\" said Art Hogan, chief\nmarket strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.\n\"The boldest, the most hawkish case, it is going to take\nwell into the next decade for the balance sheet to get to its\n'new normal' size,\" Hogan said. \"Can the market stomach that? My\nsupposition would be yes.\"\nEstimates of where the Fed plans to take its balance sheet\nrange from about $2 trillion to $3 trillion. The Fed's portfolio\nwas close to $900 billion before the 2007-2009 financial crisis\nand ballooned to near $4.5 trillion by late 2014, where it has\nroughly stayed since.\n(For a graphic on the
