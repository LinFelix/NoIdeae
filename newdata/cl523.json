Many chefs opposed the California law, saying they like preparing foie gras and their customers want to eat it.\nThe state law had been challenged by a group of Canadian duck and geese producers, the Association des Eleveurs de Canards et d'Oies du Quebec; Hudson Valley Foie Gras in Ferndale, New York; and Hot's Restaurant Group in Los Angeles.\n\"They made a mistake,\" Hudson Valley manager Marcus Henley said in an interview. \"This law has always been unconstitutional and incorrect in its basis. We won't be stopping.\"\nThe office of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, which defended the law, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nIn January 2015, U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles agreed with opponents of the foie gras ban that the federal Poultry Products Inspection Act preempted it.\nBut in Friday's decision, Circuit Judge Jacqueline Nguyen said California was simply trying to ban a feeding method it deemed cruel and inhumane.\nShe said this posed no conflict with the federal law, even if its enforcement resulted in an effective ban on foie gras.\n\"Nothing in the federal law or its implementing regulations limits a state's ability to regulate the types of poultry that may be sold for human consumption,\" Nguyen wrote.\nJared Goodman, a lawyer for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said that group was \"thrilled\" by the decision.\n\"It prohibits selling diseased livers of birds force-fed by jamming tubes down their throat and pumping concentrated food down their esophagus,\" Goodman said in an interview. \"This is truly torture and unimaginable cruelty.\"\n\n (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Richard Leong in New
