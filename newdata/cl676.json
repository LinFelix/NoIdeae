Jose's path could put it near New Jersey and New York by Wednesday morning, although it may weaken to a tropical storm again by then, the centre said.\n\nMore World News Videos Previous slide Next slide Florida Keys residents assess Irma ...

Little change in strength is forecast during the next two days, the centre said. Tropical storm watches could be issued for parts of the US coast, from North Carolina to New England, over the next day or two, according to the advisory, the 45th so far on the long-lived weather system.\n\nIf it continues toward New York City, Jose could disrupt vessels carrying crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products along the Atlantic seaboard, \"particularly those making deliveries to New York Harbour,\" Shunondo Basu, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance meteorologist and natural gas analyst in New York, said on Friday.\n\nBloomberg","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
