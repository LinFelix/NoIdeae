And although HIPAA clearly spells out when such information can be shared and how, healthcare risk managers and HIPAA compliance officers have the never-ending task of ensuring that protected health information is shared appropriately.\n\nIn the wake of the summer incident in which a detective went off the rails and arrested a Salt Lake City nurse for not standing up to his illegal request for a patient's blood sample, healthcare risk managers and police departments are reviewing their policies and protocols on access to patient information.\n\nConcerns over immigration and a new emphasis on combatting drug abuse coupled with ongoing efforts to deter drunk driving are some of the many areas of concern facing healthcare's relationship with law enforcement.\n\nDetermining when HIPAA applies at all is an ongoing challenge that requires constant training and attention to detail. State and federal courts around the country continue to interpret when subpoenas and warrants and patient consent are required for accessing such routine tests as blood-alcohol analyses following traffic accidents.\n\nTo explore changes to best practices, Melamedia, LLC, publishers of Health Information Privacy\/Security Alert is sponsoring a 60-minute webinar :\n\nBest Practices for Sharing Patient Data with Law Enforcement\n\nWednesday Oct. 25, 2017\n\n1 semx pm - 2 pm Eastern\n\nTHE FACULTY\n\nJohn R. Christiansen, JD is the principal of Christiansen IT Law and nationally recognized authority on healthcare privacy and security.
