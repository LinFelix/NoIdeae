The latest bilateral meeting was a recognition of Malaysia as a significant global player and strategic Asian partner,\" he said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nMah said Malaysia stands to reap long-term benefits by investing in a major economy such as the US, adding that local businesses will benefit from the business opportunities and access to the large US market.\n\nHe said the local technology community will also benefit through the transfer and sharing of technology and expertise.\n\n\"Investment such as purchasing of planes from Boeing, Silicon Valley, and involvement in redevelopment of US infrastructure give us the perfect opportunity to expand our expertise as we seek to grow our economy.\n\n\"Silicon Valley is the perfect place for us to prepare for our own chapter of Industrial Revolution 4.0. Hence, it is not only a prudent move but a far sighted one as well.\n\n\"Malaysian industry players can venture into new economic frontiers in US under diplomatic bridging efforts initiated and sustained by the Malaysian government,\" he said,\n\nHe chided the Opposition , saying they have been proven wrong with their \"unfounded claims\".\n\n\"The Opposition is applying double standard by criticizing the government for forging strong and mutually beneficial bilateral ties with other countries.\n\n\"Please do not politicize good efforts by the government, as partisan politicking should never supersede the collective interest of an entire nation. They should never forget that while pursuing their own political goals,\" he added.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
