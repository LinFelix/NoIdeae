When NGLs have to be pumped out, brine is pumped back into the caverns. \nEnterprise describes the Mont Belvieu complex on its website as \"the largest of its kind in the world, offering customers access to approximately 130 million barrels of underground storage capacity, and 670,000 barrels per day of NGL fractionation capability.\"\n\n (Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Tom
