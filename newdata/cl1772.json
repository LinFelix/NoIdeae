community turned out in numbers as an annual carnival celebration was held.\n\nWashington Carnival has been put on at Albany Park in the town today, with hundreds of visitors turning out despite mixed weather.\n\nFollowing a parade to the site from Backworth Colliery Brass Band, a funfair got underway with various rides while stalls, food and drink kiosks and sports activities were also put on.\n\nMusic performances were also put on, with various history and heritage groups holding exhibitions.\n\nClassic cars and vehicles were on display for motoring enthusiasts\n\nOrganiser Jemma Garrett told the Echo: \"We've had lots of things happening with fairground rides, two huge marquees with Washington History Society and the banners groups.\n\n\"We have also had a huge craft marquee which is for activities as well as lots of stalls and people such as the Women's Institute selling delicious cakes and treats.\n\n\"There is a kids tent too with circus skills, face painting and some storytelling as well.\n\n\"A petting farm is also coming along so that the children can have a hold of some animals and the military organisations are here as well for the rest of the day.\"\n\nSpeaking about the unfortunate rainy weather, Jemma added: \"I have to say I was a bit worried yesterday when we were putting everything up, but we've had a great turnout.\n\n\"I'm sure it would've been better if we'd had better weather, but people have still come out and supported the event so it's been really good.\"\n\nDerek Sleightholme, of Washington Banner Group, said: \"This kind of thing keeps the kids interested.\n\n\"There are shows for the bairns and lot of things for other people to do as well.\n\n\"The weather hasn't been great the whole time but at least it was nice when we started for the day.\n\n\"We've had plenty of people coming in to look at the banners.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
