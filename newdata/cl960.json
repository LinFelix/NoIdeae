With the population growth and the need for more resources, vegetation especially has taken the biggest blow of Human atrocity in its quest for comfort and luxury beyond necessity. We have taken so much but in return we have not done our least to replenish what we had taken.Nagaland today is not in the green heaven it used to be, although blessed with innumerable and exotic flora as well as fauna. We have lavishly exploited without replenishing much to our forest and its resources. Various efforts have been taken to bring about afforestation and protection of our forests for climate change.\n\nA success story was scripted in May of 2015 in the Pughoboto subdivision, when a massive plantation drive was carried out like no other under the theme 'Green Pughoboto' for the 24 villages under Pughoboto division, initiated by the local MLA and the then Minister of Roads and Bridges, Y. Vikheho Swu under the Local Area Development programme (2016-17) along with the Sub divisional Administration under the ADC Avelu Ruho. The minister personally took to the plantation drive where 17,000 saplings were planted along with the support of the local populace.The saplings included Gul Mohor, Silver oak, Nahor, Ashoka, bottle brush and many other ornamental trees having good aesthetic values.Unlike the regular plantation drive where after the media coverage, the saplings are made to fend for themselves, the consistent nurturing of those trees planted have now grown to healthy trees.The region has a reason to smile over efforts that is now yielding progress in its efforts for conservation. Consecutively, the second phase of Green Pughoboto project was carried out on the 12th May 2017 for all the 24 villages, more than 10,000 saplings were distributed and the minister himself enthusiastically planted several trees in the ongoing construction site of Pughoboto Mini secretariat. The minister strongly envisioned totransform Pughoboto into the most beautiful green area in the state. The project had the positive support of the administration, Churches, students, Youth and women organizations and individuals.\n\nThe Green Pughoboto project initiated the MLA was also greatly successful also because of the assistance of dedicated officers like Forest Ranger Pughoboto Mr. Kihoto Wotsa and Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF) Dimapur Mr. Obed Swu who provided the saplings for the two plantation drives. The theme was initiated to communicate a very practical message of the importance of planting trees and promoting healthy environment as everyone's responsibility. One of the main highlights of the projectis, introducing cash award of Rs.5(five) lakhs to the cleanest village, with Ghathashi village claiming the award in 2015 and Kilomi village in 2016. This has been a big boost to the morale of the villagers in the campaign for protection and conservation of the forests.\n\nThe other primary aim of Green Pughoboto is to make Pughoboto a hub for commercial supply of timber. The traditional subsistence agriculture can be revolutionised with agro-forestry projects, which combines aspects of forestry and farming to create plantations which can meet the commercial timber needs of local as well as international markets. Every village is envisioned to host a timber park, with that Vision, commercial plant nurseries have been set up at many designated places, such like Pughoboto, Lazami, Ghathashi, Asukiqa and KT (KhuchoTsuyi). Backed by subsidies and other incentives, the farmers have been the main stay and the younger generation also has been joining hands. Pughoboto a landlocked region has been endowed with very rich vegetation and even the topography and climatic condition supports variety of vegetation. Plants which are not indigenous to the region have adapted well and have been yielding rich harvest. The viability of the region to go for intensive commercial plantation has been quite encouraging. With that potentiality, Vikheho has been emphasising that \"a hilly terrain such as ours, besides jhum cultivation has lesser scope for other economic prospects and therefore should focus on tree plantation which is a sure prospective return\".These projects have a significant positive impact on the environment, along with sustainable profits. The plantation projects operate against a background of accelerating urbanization, which is increasing the need for wood and putting pressure on existing forests.\n\nPlantation has always been more than twin kill with one bullet.The ability to combine profitability and development, it Increases positive climatic change with both the flora and fauna flourishing, also enabling the ability to earn huge income through commercial timber, herbal products also has been on higher demand with subsequent technological improvement in the field of herbal sciences, the aesthetic value it holds also promotes tourism. Undeniably, there are numerous obstacles, starting from the nature itself which often decides the progress of the plants themselves, but more severe is the attitude of our humans who fail to knowingly address the need of our ecological environment. The need for holistic environmental conservation needs to come over the politics, ism or any social issues as it for everyone that breathes. Pamela and her husband efforts in Karnataka, Jadav Payeng from Assam conversion of 550 hectares over 30 years into a natural habitat are just some examples of how human efforts has the power to change the very course of nature for our welfare.Nagaland has still the ability to convert the much needed environment conservation and afforestation within lesser time duration or lesser effort given the vegetation and the climatic condition with which we are blessed, only our mindset should change and our thoughts be put into action.\n\nGreen Pughoboto is not only an effort to promote the area but for the whole of Nagaland who are yet to promote environment conservation. For it should not end in plantation programme alone, but with consistent nurturing till we see the fruits of our efforts. The inconsistent weather pattern, the climatic change, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ground water level in Nagaland could get even worse. A comparative analysis of the Forest Survey of India (FSI) Report indicates that Nagaland has lost 352 sq.km in forest cover since 2011. As per data compiled by the FSI in 2013, the state recorded a decrease of 274 sq.km in forest cover - the highest among Indian states at the time - during the period following the compilation of the 2011 report. The 2015 report indicated a considerable decline in forest cover lost at 78 sq.km as compared to 2013. A positive 2017 report is still daunting. The National statisticsaccounts the maximum loss registered in the state Nagaland. The deforestation and pollution are our responsibility and God gave us plants and animals to live on it and by it. The abrupt climatic change that has been witnessed in the recent years has been that of a deteriorating one and unless a pragmatic effort is taken up, the pace of climatic chaos would worsen.\n\nIn conclusion, if you haven't thought much about plantation. A man from Pughoboto who had planted commercial timber in somewhere in the year 1997-98 on a barren jhum cultivated field is now harvesting his timber and his profit is somewhere from Rs.30 to 35 crores. Contributing to afforestation as well as his personal revenue.\n\nTree plantation the best life insurance and the best Banking Account, Think!","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
