gay, bi and trans players and fans.\n\nUnited and the Gunners both uploaded an image of a rainbow-coloured armband to their social media accounts on Friday morning.\n\nIt follows on from last year's rainbow laces-themed activities across both professional and grass roots sports clubs.\n\nThe Premier League have been actively involved and featured the campaign last November.\n\nPerimeter advertising and a giant Premier League Rainbow Laces flag to open games were amongst the additional acts of support.\n\nIn addition to Premier League Clubs, teams from the Championship, League One and League Two, English Football League, Premiership Rugby and Welsh Rugby were also involved.\n\nThe initiative follows Stonewall research that shows 72 per cent of football fans have heard homophobic abuse at grounds around the country.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
