It said that 1,472 counties could have only one insurer in 2018.\nInsurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc have exited most of the states where they sold Obamacare plans. They cited uncertainty over the healthcare legislation and whether the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump will maintain subsidies that keep costs down.\nBut other insurers, like Centene Corp, have filled those gaps, expanding into new counties that had lost their coverage options.\nEarlier this week, a spokesperson for Virginia's insurance regulator said the state was in serious negotiations to bring in an insurer to cover its bare counties. \nAnthem has said that it is still working with some state regulators on its market participation for next year.\n\n\n (Reporting by
