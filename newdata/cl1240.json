Picture: Simon Bennett\n\nView More Local BusinessList Your Business Here\n\nResidents will have to wait until 2022 to visit Narellan's new $12 million community and sports club.\n\nClub Marconi secured an option to purchase land on Porrende Street, Narellan - next to the site of the Narellan Sports Hub - in 2016.\n\nThe proposed community club, to be known as the Macarthur Community and Sporting Club, was originally slated to open later this year but planning delays have halted construction.\n\nClub Marconi chief operating officer Tony Zappia said consultants and architects were in the process of putting together the building's design.\n\n\"We are looking at three to six months for that process and we also have some building changes we want to submit to Camden Council,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a multi-million dollar exercise so we are looking at completion within the next three to five years. Our aim is 2022.\"\n\nThe new club will include an outdoor cafe, family dining areas, bars, a gaming lounge, a children's playground, meeting rooms as well as childcare and aged care facilities.\n\nMr Zappia said the club would support a range of community and sporting groups through grants and sponsorship opportunities.\n\n\"We don't just want to sponsor one club in particular, we are open to different organisations,\" he said.\n\n\"Obviously we can't sponsor everyone but we hope to sponsor a range of different community and sporting clubs.\"\n\nMr Zappia said Macarthur was already home to many Club Marconi members.\n\n\"We have a lot of members out here - I call them our extended family,\" he said.\n\n\"We recognised this niche market in a growing community so we wanted to bring our services to Macarthur.\"\n\nMr Zappia said the future Macarthur Community and Sporting Club would look and feel different to Club Marconi's original Bossley Park location.\n\nHe said the new location would still be a family orientated venue.\n\nClub Marconi, named after Italian radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi, opened in 1958 and is one of Sydney's most recognisable clubs.\n\n\"Marconi was established by early Italian settlers so its roots are in Italian culture,\" he said.\n\n\"What we are doing in Macarthur will be different.\n\n\"We see the club as a family-friendly community facility to meet the needs of the growing area.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
