Europe-wide tax reform is a huge headache in the European Union, requiring unanimity of all 28 states, which has proven nearly impossible on tax issues.\n\nMinisters from smaller member states already hinted at difficulties, warning that they would much prefer the problem be addressed at the international level, such as at the G20 or through the OECD, the club of rich nations.\n\n\"I think we should be very careful not to tax on what we are going to live on in the future,\" said Danish Finance Minister Kristian Jensen.\n\n\"I am... always sceptical by new taxes and I think Europe taxes heavily enough,\" he added.\n\nThe OECD has also poured doubt on the proposal.\n\nGenerally speaking, \"taxes on revenues, they're daft\", said Pascal Saint-Amans, the OECD's tax policy director during a hearing on Wednesday at the French parliament.\n\nBut \"politically, I understand that it may be necessary, given that reform led by the OECD at the G20 level could take years to achieve.\n\nThe commission, the EU's executive arm, has been tasked to draw up a set of solutions, including the French proposal, in time for an EU summit in Tallinn on September 29.\n\nEuropeans have become increasingly aggressive against US technology giants seen by officials as gaining too much power, with Amazon and Apple also under scrutiny.\n\nMoreover, several national authorities in the EU have opened up tax fights with Google, Airbnb and other Internet giants.\n\nA French court, citing EU law, ruled in July that Google was not liable for 1.12 billion euros ($1.27 billion) in taxes claimed by the state. France appealed the decision.AFP.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
