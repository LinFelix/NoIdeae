Produced for the New Hampshire Storytelling Alliance (NHSA), by Lauretta Phillips of Andover, the event will bring together more than a dozen experienced storytellers to share their tales throughout the weekend.\n\nBrooks has engaged and transfixed audiences with his powerful performances all over New England. Raised in Worcester, England, Simon honed his storytelling skills while traveling throughout Europe. He moved to the US in 1994, lived on both coasts and settled in New Hampshire more than 12 years ago.\n\nBrooks' storytelling has earned him honors from Storytelling World and Parent's Choice, including the latter's prestigious Gold Award for his storytelling CDs. Brooks' distinctive voice and accent have served him well as a voice actor, recording a number of audio books for other writers.\n\nSharon Wood of Claremont performs a family storytelling concert at 4 p.m. Saturday. Wood is a professional storyteller, specializing in world folklore and American history.\n\nWood graduated from Southern Connecticut State College with a degree in early childhood education and taught kindergarten for five years before retiring to raise her own children. In Claremont, she worked both at the Fiske Free Library and as St. Mary School's librarian for about 25 years. She has also been an active volunteer for St. Joseph Church, the Off Broad Street Players, Claremont Historical Society and across the river with the Springfield Community Players.\n\nWood and her husband Steve began storytelling and historical presentations in the mid-1990s, at first as a hobby, but then as a serious independent business. They have been researching and portraying the Lincolns since 1995, winning numerous awards.\n\nThe festival features storytelling concerts for all ages throughout the weekend, beginning with a free Ghost Story Concert at 7:30 p.m. Friday and ending with Sacred Tales at 9 a.m. Sunday.\n\nVisit NH Storytelling Alliance Website at http:\/\/nhstorytelling.org\/festival. Ticket prices are listed and registration may be done online. Tickets will also be available at the event and may be purchased individually for specific concerts or for the festival as a whole. For more information contact Lauretta Phillips at events@nhstorytelling.org or (603) 735-5965.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
