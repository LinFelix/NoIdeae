Instead, we should use them to set new baselines and ask hard questions of Hollywood.\n\nThe first benchmark that's useful to extract from Jenkins' Wonder Woman contract is monetary: Her deal apparently makes her the highest-paid female director ever and sets a new mark that other women will be able to use in comparable situations.\n\nOne measure of whether Jenkins' contract is a force for change in Hollywood is whether another female director is able to sign a similar deal or whether Jenkins will end up alone on that pinnacle.\n\nOf course, we should also be careful not to over-interpret this baseline, either. If Kathryn Bigelow or Ava DuVernay decides to take the minimum weekly salary of US$18,676, as guaranteed by the Directors Guild of America contract, in order to make a movie come in under budget, that doesn't make them sellouts to feminism or mean their production companies are being unfair.\n\nInstead, the test is whether female directors in the same situation as Jenkins - directing a sequel to an extremely popular movie - get paid the same.\n\nA secondary measure is whether salaries for first-time female and non-white directors of blockbusters keep pace with those of their white male counterparts.\n\nThe second measurement to keep an eye on is whether Jenkins' deal gives her a meaningful amount of creative freedom, keeping in mind that she's working in a highly regimented franchise system.\n\nAnd finally, the real test for whether big franchise deals for innovative directors is a good thing for the industry is what they do next. Since directing The Avengers, Whedon has directed a low-budget adaptation of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing and is rumoured to have something called \"Untitled Joss Whedon\/WWII Horror Project\" in the works. But otherwise, he has been largely sucked into the world of superheroics.\n\nUnless Jenkins decides this is what she wants to do fulltime, I would consider Jenkins' Wonder Woman deal a failure if it means that she spends the rest of her career directing franchise movies.\n\nIn an ideal world, the relationship would go both ways. Franchises like Marvel, DC and Star Wars would get an infusion of energy and personality from promising directors with distinctive visions.\n\nAnd in turn, those directors would get a lot of attention and the credential of having directed a huge, logistically complex movie in a challenging corporate environment that ought to make it easier for them to get their original projects funded.\n\nOtherwise, the exchange looks a little bit vampiric: Talented directors get paid large sums of money to essentially take themselves off the original movie market.\n\nI'm excited for Jenkins to get paid because she deserves it, and because I want to see what she does with that money and reputation. Wonder Woman was fun, but it's not the true revolution that Hollywood needs.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
