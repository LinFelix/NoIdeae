Must be proactive! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nSeptember 15, 2017\n\nLoser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner.The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nSeptember 15, 2017\n\n\"Whether Trump is right in that the people behind this were known to the authorities already, we don't yet know,\" Farage said.\n\n\"But in most cases the pattern is very clear. These are young males who have dropped out of education, who've drifted into drugs and extreme forms of Islam, and in nearly every single case, they are known to the authorities,\" he continued.\n\nTrump faced criticism from British officials and Prime Minister Theresa May for his comments after the attack, which appeared to share potentially privileged information. May said it is never helpful for someone to speculate on an ongoing investigation.\n\nThis is not the first time the president has faced backlash for commenting on a UK terror attack.\n\nShortly after an attack in central London last June, in which a driver struck several people on London Bridge, the president also took to Twitter to use the incident to score political points.\n\nWe must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don't get smart it will only get worse -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nJune 4, 2017\n\nDo you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nJune 4, 2017\n\nAt least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \"no reason to be alarmed!\" -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nJune 4, 2017\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan slammed Trump for the tweets and called on the British government to rescind an invitation for the president to visit the country.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 20:07:48.666"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 20:07:48.114","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|Yrff80V\/wzLuCtQaF4B2DQEycY0=|NPqxU4938uVLBTzL\/eq6vZ1OknUeFLNKs9DXAvgAOEtm0s6G0PmxeQ==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.941,"name":"Politics"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/24c4ea88-f45a-3a3a-8293-8a7ca1fde5c9","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Donald Trump on social media","importance":"1","originalValue":"Donald Trump on social media"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/26585b85-a498-31bb-abc9-70fdd3d7fb7c","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Social media","importance":"1","originalValue":"Social media"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/e1deb7db-1a06-3168-8430-de8619280a93","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Twitter","importance":"1","originalValue":"Twitter"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/fbe86693-274d-3a47-a6b0-a677e7252017","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Euroscepticism","importance":"2","originalValue":"Euroscepticism"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/5e6b0d94-4f12-3589-953e-16a1ff786c9f","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Politics","importance":"2","originalValue":"Politics"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/9efd0bee-0479-336f-a246-d987f6406804","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Business","importance":"2","originalValue":"Business"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/7":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/7","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/70a49b00-55d8-3dca-a88f-e26b86216054","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Donald Trump","importance":"2","originalValue":"Donald Trump"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/8":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/8","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/2b323da8-45e9-356d-8713-4c7a1949354e","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Nigel Farage","importance":"2","originalValue":"Nigel Farage"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/9":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/af22b904-7958-35bf-83bb-edf916719253\/SocialTag\/9","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/06489172-27af-3817-95d2-9918da837b68","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Knight First Amendment Institute v.
