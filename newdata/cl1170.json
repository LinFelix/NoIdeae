With that in mind, the distance runner set about to step on to the podium.\n\n\"Being in the age group 17+ I knew it was going to be a tough time finishing on the podium in some races. I was going in to the comp hoping for a podium finish in my 3km and 2km steeple and running my first ever sub two minute 800m, but conditions made it tough,\" he said.\n\n\"The steeple being my last race and not having a medal yet that was my main goal for this race to finish on the podium. Having Matt and Henry [Sindel] there is always good in a race because I know we can all run close to the same times, so having them will always help for a fast race. My results weren't the best only coming away with one medal where I left the comp with three medals last year but overall I'm happy with the outcomes I produced in the given conditions with a 12th, fourth and second.\"\n\nFor Geddes, Youman and Campion, it is the last year they have to compete at the carnivals with the trio completing their Higher School Certificates this year.\n\nThe Armidale athlete has set his sights on finishing his school athletics career on a high with a national finish.\n\n\"I have a competition in four weeks, being NSW All Schools, then NSW relays in November and hopefully finish off the year with the Australian All Schools,\" he said.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
