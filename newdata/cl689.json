Northam had to spend heavily to defeat a well-funded challenge from former U.S. Rep. Tom Perriello. Gillespie did not spend as much, but was nearly upset by an underfunded Trump-like candidate.\n\nVirginia is one of only two states electing governors in 2017. The contest is getting national attention as a potential early referendum on President Donald Trump.\n\nIn addition to both campaigns, politically active out-of-state groups backed by billionaire donors -- including Charles and David Koch, Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer -- have pledged to spend millions of dollars on the race.\n\nVirginia has a no-limit campaign finance system. In 2013, the candidates combined to spend about $60 million on that election. The winner, Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, is not allowed to seek a second term under Virginia's Constitution.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
