Amy is fine. She has been perfectly nice to me. She is intelligent, and and interesting to talk to. As a person, I like her quite a lot. She is however, massively controlling of my father. I mean really, seriously, controls his every move. And its not just him, she is really controlling of her friends as well. For example, my dad has a curfew when he has to be home and once when I wanted to sit on his front porch and have a glass of wine with him, he told me he couldn't because Amy was working in her office and couldn't join us and he couldn't do that without her.\n\nI don't say anything about this though, because my dad and I aren't super close (he physically and emotionally (not sexually) abused us as kids), and in the past my dad has has been pretty blatant about deceiving and cheating on his wives and girlfriends (including Amy). I figure whatever weird controlling mess he's in, is his business to figure out.\n\nI expect nothing from my Dad, but I do enjoy our occasional visits. The new wife does not let us visit without her being present, which is generally not too annoying because, like I say, I find her an interesting person who I usually enjoy hanging out with. The problem is that from the beginning, she has made it a BIG deal that she wants me to meet her daughter and son in law. I was OK with that but I didn't think there was any rush or anything. We are all adults, I'm not super close with my Dad, its not like we are \"blending families\" or anything. But the longer its taken to happen, the more insistent Amy and my dad have become. So strangely (to my mind) insistent, that now I've really got my back up about it and have been avoiding visiting when the daughter and son in law are in town. But now Amy's daughter and son in law have moved to the town Amy and my father live in and I'm going for a visit this month (in case this is relevant, I have other reasons to go to the town where my Dad lives, its not a visit just to see them. I don't stay with them when I visit).\n\nI called to let my dad know I would be in town and asked to take my Dad and Amy out to dinner for my dad's birthday, giving them a choice of nights that I would be free. They ignored my request to take them to dinner saying instead that they want me to meet the daughter and son in law but don't know how the daughter and son in laws schedules will be for the week so they can't commit to a date yet. Further, they want me to go \"see the daughter and son in law's new house to see what they've done with it.\"\n\nI DO NOT want to do this. I can't exactly explain, even to myself, why I just really don't want this, but everything in me is totally opposed to it. For some reason it makes me feel a bit ill. Maybe its because of my history with my dad that I really want to keep him at arms length, or maybe its the sense that I've gotten that Amy needs to prove how wonderful her family is (I have no idea what she's heard about our family before she came along but the reality was that it was pretty awful). I've begun to get the feeling that she is dead set on showing me she is in control of everything now. Anyway, the whole situation just really creeps me out.\n\nI don't want to have to forfeit my few visits with my dad so I feel like I need to be careful how I respond to this. if I make Amy mad, she can easily cut me off from ever seeing my Dad again. If I have to be I am reluctantly OK with the daughter and son in law going to dinner with us, though I didn't invite them originally and I'd rather not pay for their dinners, but I am NOT OK with going to their house and acting like, \"oh isn't it great, we're gonna all be so close and family-like now.\"\n\nAny thoughts on how best to keep this from becoming a big mess? How can I steer them away from the house visit?\n\nThanks.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
