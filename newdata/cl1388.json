And the Klaasen-Roelofse pair obliged with style and panache to give their country a 2-1 lead in the three-day tie.\n\nAs a result of Klaasen's emergence as one of the world's premier doubles players, the 48th-ranked KIA SA Davis Cup team were favourites going into Saturday's rubber, even though Denmark are in 43rd slot. The SA pairing are undefeated in five outings since 2015.\n\nAny doubts about the impact Klaasen could have on the contest were dispelled when he intervened with great authority in the fifth and sixth games of the first.\n\nIn the fifth, Roelofse's serve was under great pressure at 15-40 as the Danes were poised to make a breakthrough. However, Klaasen stepped up and did a hatchet job at the net. Three breakpoints later, Roelofse held serve to keep SA's nose in front at 3-2.\n\nNielsen, a former Wimbledon doubles winner (2012 with Brit Jonathan Marray), was also powerless to stop the wizardry of Klaasen when he served in the sixth game, which he dropped 15-40. Roelofse also came into his own with decisive play as the Danes tried to steer clear of Klaasen's path and SA surged ahead 4-2\n\nWith the break under the belt, the South Africans signed off with a 6-3 first-set win after the remaining games went with serve.\n\nThe SA duo, now bristling with confidence, were unstoppable in the second set as they raced to a 6-0 rout when their relentless pressure took its toll on the opposition.\n\nThe Danes bounced back in the third set to salvage some pride, but once the South Africans secured a break in the fifth they were well on their way to a straight-sets triumph which they signed off with a 6-3 6-0 6-4 scoreline after 101 minutes.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 19:41:40.379"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 19:41:39.967","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|EKwDMSwjlqKfbj0ZvxWCftp+ZS4=|NvoQYiq0neAUKJGpboTlpeCl3g9z9lc20aD0NKK3yjuuxVZQixhDvw==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1c6b73cc-0371-3489-a4e1-b26803b5e3c6\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.989,"name":"Sports"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1c6b73cc-0371-3489-a4e1-b26803b5e3c6\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1c6b73cc-0371-3489-a4e1-b26803b5e3c6\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1c6b73cc-0371-3489-a4e1-b26803b5e3c6\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/42c21c18-a33c-30c8-842c-c4fb87d8aa97","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Tennis","importance":"1","originalValue":"Tennis"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1c6b73cc-0371-3489-a4e1-b26803b5e3c6\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1c6b73cc-0371-3489-a4e1-b26803b5e3c6\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/9848f795-198f-3ec4-9e5e-325de8b0c6ef","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Frederik Nielsen","importance":"1","originalValue":"Frederik Nielsen"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1c6b73cc-0371-3489-a4e1-b26803b5e3c6\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1c6b73cc-0371-3489-a4e1-b26803b5e3c6\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/27b583a6-1488-3d2f-a3b1-0d9eb7a48645","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Jonathan Marray","importance":"1","originalValue":"Jonathan Marray"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1c6b73cc-0371-3489-a4e1-b26803b5e3c6\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Banks -
