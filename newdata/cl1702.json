Information about the confidentiality breach was also posted to the department's website, humanservices.arkansas.gov.\n\nAttempts to reach Farrar by phone were unsuccessful Friday. Memphis attorney Alan Crone, who is representing Farrar in her lawsuit against the department, didn't return phone messages left at his office.\n\nWebb said Farrar's firing in March was for \"violations of DHS policy on professionalism, teamwork and diligent and professional performance.\"\n\nAccording to her lawsuit, filed July 11 in U.S. District Court in Little Rock, Farrar had worked for the department since Oct. 6.\n\nHer duties included \"reviewing reimbursement coding procedures for billing discrepancies in Medicaid, implementing initiatives based on available database information, and reviewing old systems for loopholes and reimbursement issues,\" according to the suit.\n\nShe said in the suit that she was treated more harshly than her co-workers because she is black and that her firing came after she filed an internal complaint over discrimination and asked if she should speak with someone at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces federal laws prohibiting discrimination.\n\nThe department denied discriminating against Farrar. A trial date has not been set.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 19:53:07.510"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 19:53:07.018","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|RjyqjBFcTuMHPhUMKVFGQnDNtz0=|EGBOcDBtA4u6l6l7th6+FI\/BrTg5JK\/Bf2Tyv5zjplAimJX\/mzAD2Q==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/4bfd0a2d-0bd0-3a15-a8f4-9d133538b4ce\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.963,"name":"Law_Crime"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/4bfd0a2d-0bd0-3a15-a8f4-9d133538b4ce\/cat\/2":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.804,"name":"Labor"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/4bfd0a2d-0bd0-3a15-a8f4-9d133538b4ce\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/4bfd0a2d-0bd0-3a15-a8f4-9d133538b4ce\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/4bfd0a2d-0bd0-3a15-a8f4-9d133538b4ce\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/4e1fa790-4863-3c91-bd0f-7f21e536fa86","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Child poverty","importance":"1","originalValue":"Child poverty"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/4bfd0a2d-0bd0-3a15-a8f4-9d133538b4ce\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/4bfd0a2d-0bd0-3a15-a8f4-9d133538b4ce\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/07e6c323-e6ca-37a0-9a7f-d2eb40019ae2","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Federal assistance in the United States","importance":"1","originalValue":"Federal assistance in the United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/4bfd0a2d-0bd0-3a15-a8f4-9d133538b4ce\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/4bfd0a2d-0bd0-3a15-a8f4-9d133538b4ce\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/8cdbd403-8d54-3b3c-b5b4-72088f7c1740","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Healthcare reform in the United States","importance":"1","originalValue":"Healthcare reform in the United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/4bfd0a2d-0bd0-3a15-a8f4-9d133538b4ce\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/4bfd0a2d-0bd0-3a15-a8f4-9d133538b4ce\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/ffaf2a23-5691-3143-8a46-9c358e451dea","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Medicaid","importance":"2","originalValue":"Medicaid"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/4bfd0a2d-0bd0-3a15-a8f4-9d133538b4ce\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/4bfd0a2d-0bd0-3a15-a8f4-9d133538b4ce\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/e290d538-6014-354f-a7e3-3fd529c93ac7","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Presidency of Lyndon B.
