Another system further east in the Atlantic has developed into Tropical Storm Lee, according to the National Weather Service Miami.\n\nIt's still too early to tell what impact, if any, the systems will have on South Florida.\n\nThe closer system, known as Potential Tropical Cyclone 15, has a 100 percent chance of development over the next 48 hours and was moving west at 22 mph, as of 11 a.m. Saturday.\n\nThe system is currently 755 miles east-southeast of the Lesser Antillies.\n\nThe islands of St. Lucia, Martinique, Guadeloupe and Dominica have all issued Tropical Storm Watches which means tropical storm conditions could be seen in those areas in the next 48 hours.\n\nChris Fisher, a meteorologist for the national weather service in Miami says low wind shear and warm waters are helping the storm develop.\n\nForecasters are also watching Tropical Storm Lee about 650 miles east of the Cabo Verde Islands of the coast of Africa. That one is not expected to be a threat, Fisher says.\n\nIt is forecast to make a gradual turn to the west-northwest early next week.\n\nAs of 11 a.m. Saturday, TS Lee is moving west at 12 mph with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. Conditions for development are expected to get worse after Sunday, forecasters say.\n\n\"At this point, it doesn't look like it should impact anything,\" said Fisher. \"It's mainly going to be a fish storm at this point,\"\n\nThe National Hurricane Center's latest tropical weather maps show both as heading generally toward the Caribbean. It's not possible to forecast with any certainty where they would go beyond that.\n\nAll this as Tropical Storm Jose once again morphed into a hurricane and continues to circle in the Atlantic.\n\nAs of an 11 a.m. advisory, Hurricane Jose had sustained winds of 80 mph and was moving northwest at 9 mph.\n\n\"It's not going to have any impact in south Florida but folks in the Northeast will be keeping an eye on that,\" Fisher said.\n\nHe said Jose is expected to maintain Hurricane strength winds but weaken into a tropical storm around the middle of next week due to the cooler waters further north and wind shear.\n\nJose is expected to stay a few hundred miles off the coast of North Carolina before staying east of Virginia Tuesday morning and east of Massachusetts Wednesday morning.\n\nThese developments are a reminder that as Florida tries to rebound from Irma, hurricane season is not over.\n\n\"We've still got a couple months of hurricane season so we have plenty of time for additional development over the next month or two,\" Fisher said.\n\nStaff writers Tonya Alanez and Brett Clarkson contributed to this report.\n\nbrettclarkson@sun-sentinel.com or Twitter @BrettClarkson_","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 19:41:17.735"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 19:41:17.324","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|5tUxB7Ct+hIRHrZwv3ifgewH8x8=|PxTO5rsrR6OZ+Z1EOfS72A9dML2MrLMSkfMm8pZFqBZXBJ+C+seg\/g==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/fbcceb33-366e-39ef-9871-46ea5f29199a\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":1,"name":"Weather"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/fbcceb33-366e-39ef-9871-46ea5f29199a\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/fbcceb33-366e-39ef-9871-46ea5f29199a\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/fbcceb33-366e-39ef-9871-46ea5f29199a\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/f3e23144-f9f0-3f83-b041-8a0f09fe2bf7","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Atlantic hurricane seasons","importance":"1","originalValue":"Atlantic hurricane seasons"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/fbcceb33-366e-39ef-9871-46ea5f29199a\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/fbcceb33-366e-39ef-9871-46ea5f29199a\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/1d2df0f0-525c-3f9a-a084-42dea4bdc082","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"World history","importance":"1","originalValue":"World history"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/fbcceb33-366e-39ef-9871-46ea5f29199a\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/fbcceb33-366e-39ef-9871-46ea5f29199a\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/b6b8b06b-cafe-3738-ae57-3e142e318f6a","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Time","importance":"1","originalValue":"Time"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/fbcceb33-366e-39ef-9871-46ea5f29199a\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Medical Equipment, Supplies & Distribution -
