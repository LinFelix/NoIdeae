The same way will not help us. Biblical miracles are history now. God does not reward laziness and mediocrity, He rewards hardwork,\" he said.\n\nDr Alhaji Mahamudu Bawumia, the Vice President, asked Asogli youth to take lessons from the Festival and rekindle communal spirit and patriotism.\n\n\"Elders are the teachers of civic responsibility and must instil proper discipline and pride in the youth...that is how we shape the norms of society...this is how we make ourselves better,\" he said.\n\nDr Bawumia said the Free SHS was just the start of many good things adding that the policy would benefit all.\n\nHe said teacher trainee allowance would be restored this month and that of nurses next month and reiterated Government's commitment to the construction of the Eastern Corridor road and the construction of a bridge on River Oti.\n\nDr Bawumia announced that Government would soon launch a digital address system to enhance commerce and governance.\n\nThe festival attracted members of the diplomatic corps and local and foreign tourists.\n\nGNA","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
