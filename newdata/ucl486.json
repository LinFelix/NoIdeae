All three girls were 12 at the time. The stabbing victim, who Reuters has not named, survived the attack. \nWeier pled guilty as part of a plea agreement in August to attempted second-degree homicide as a party to a crime with use of a deadly weapon, court records show. \nAs part of the agreement, the jury was instructed to decide whether Weier's mental condition would have made her legally responsible for her actions during the attack. \nIf the 12 jurors found Weier was legally responsible, prosecutors were planning to recommend a sentence of 10 years in prison and 10 years of extended supervision, according to the Journal Sentinel. \nGeyser is scheduled for trial in October. \nAfter a sleepover with their classmate and friend, Weier and Geyser lured her into the woods and stabbed her 19 times with a kitchen knife, according to a criminal complaint. \nThe girls told investigators they stabbed her to impress Slenderman, a tall, creepy fictional bogeyman they insisted was real, the complaint said. \n\n (Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Tom Hogue)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 10:40:43.297"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 10:40:43.032","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|zixwAy8sp7WR6RF2TFutKVRr8yM=|QnIDbJ6EagbMP\/2kNjEqrcQg4Ilhh0PVNfKcL2Fr5Nny6eFLXz9NuQ==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.997,"name":"Law_Crime"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/7b346e6a-88cd-3093-963b-a3462b5c20dd","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Slender Man","importance":"1","originalValue":"Slender Man"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/631aa4dc-d393-301f-b15a-28f425e9ab83","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Slender Man stabbing","importance":"1","originalValue":"Slender Man stabbing"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/2bd9b977-78f8-35d9-be45-1634ef6dbd99","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Waukesha, Wisconsin","importance":"1","originalValue":"Waukesha, Wisconsin"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/69114be8-5b49-39c2-9cf7-55fdf1d978d1","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Waukesha","importance":"2","originalValue":"Waukesha"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/27cc3c32-c4eb-3d86-999c-737f6d86b8c5","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Fads","importance":"2","originalValue":"Fads"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/498191cb-995f-33df-8870-c0aa4a5c5d0b","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Popular culture","importance":"2","originalValue":"Popular culture"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/SocialTag\/7":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/SocialTag\/7","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/8802cc97-e83a-3d7d-b3b5-b3efb8e1d8de","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Fiction","importance":"2","originalValue":"Fiction"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6c71de92-11fd-3fb7-8894-554e9bf4be2e\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Professional Information Services -
