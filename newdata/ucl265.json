It urged the KRG to \"enter\ninto serious and sustained dialogue with Baghdad, which the\nUnited States has repeatedly indicated it is prepared to\nfacilitate.\"\nThe regional parliament's decision came despite an intense\ndiplomatic drive by the United States, which has provided\ncritical military aid to the KRG's fight against Islamic State,\nto persuade the Kurdish leadership to cancel the referendum.\nThe parliament session was the first held since the\nlegislature was suspended nearly two years ago, though only 68\nof 111 lawmakers attended due to a boycott by the main\nopposition movement Gorran.\n\"We've been waiting more than 100 years for this,\" Omed\nKhoshnaw, a lawmaker from the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDR)\nof KRG President Massoud Barzani, told Reuters.\n\"There is no other way to guarantee that genocide will never\nbe repeated,\" Khoshnaw told the assembly earlier, referring to\nthe persecution of the Kurds and their expulsion from areas such\nas oil-rich Kirkuk under late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.\nSome lawmakers wore Kurdish flags and rose to clap and sing\nthe national anthem after the vote.\nThe Baghdad parliament's decision earlier this week to\noppose the referendum drew condemnation from deputies in Erbil.\n\"We refuse to accept the Iraqi parliament's decision, which\nwas unlawful,\" Muna Qahwachi, a Turkman lawmaker, told Reuters.\nQahwachi said she had voted in favour of the referendum\nbecause she said Turkmen were protected in Kurdistan, unlike in\nthe rest of Iraq.\n\nPRESSURE REBUFFED\nEarlier, Barzani shrugged off requests from the United\nStates and other Western powers to put off the referendum. They\nfear increased tensions between Baghdad and Erbil will distract\nfrom the war on Islamic State militants who still occupy parts\nof Iraq and Syria.\n\"We still haven't heard a proposal that can be an\nalternative to the Kurdistan referendum,\" Barzani told a rally\nin the Kurdish region, referring to a proposal put forward by\nthe United States and other Western envoys this week.\nIraq's neighbours Iran and Turkey also oppose the\nplebiscite, fearing an independent Kurdish state could fuel\nseparatism among their own Kurdish populations.\nThe opposition Gorran movement boycotted Friday's\nparliamentary session, the first since a dispute between them\nand Barzani's KDP caused the suspension of the assembly in\nOctober 2015.\n\"Those assembled in parliament today think this is a lawful\nsession, but this is unlawful,\" Birzu Majeed, the head of\nGorran's parliamentary block, told a news conference held while\nparliament was in session.\nLawmakers from a third party, the Patriotic Union of\nKurdistan (PUK), ensured the required quorum. The PUK is a\nhistoric rival of the KDP but supports the referendum plan.\nMeanwhile, Iranian-backed Iraqi Shi'ite paramilitary groups\nhave threatened to dislodge the Kurdish forces from the Kirkuk\nregion, which is due to take part in the referendum.\nKirkuk is home to sizeable Arab and Turkmen populations and\nlies outside the official boundaries of the Kurdistan region. It\nis claimed by both the Kurds and the central government in\nBaghad.\nKurdish peshmerga fighters seized Kirkuk and other disputed\nterritories when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic\nState in 2014, preventing its oilfields from falling into\nmilitant hands.\n(Reporting by Raya Jalabi; Additional reporting by Jonathan\nLanday in Washington; Editing by Gareth Jones and
