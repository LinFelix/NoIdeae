The idea is to improve Siri, rather than anything more alarming, the tech giant says.\n\nEvery step you take\n\nYou may not know this, but Apple is counting and recording every step you take - and you've 'opted in' by default.\n\nRegardless of whether you use the Health app, it's recording this data.\n\nYou can turn it off via Settings > Privacy > Motion and Fitness.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
