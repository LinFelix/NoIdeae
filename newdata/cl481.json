Protesters said native fish like Chinook salmon and steelhead trout were already struggling before the spill.\n\"Our wild salmon are in trouble and we can't afford to have an industry in our state that only adds to their problems,\" Kurt Beardslee, head of activist group Wild Fish Conservancy and organizer of the protest, said in a telephone interview.\nCooke, which is privately owned, said in an email to Reuters that it \"apologizes humbly for this accident,\" which is under investigation by state regulators. The company pledged to review operations of other fish pens it has in Washington.\nNative American tribes said they were told by Cooke and by state officials to \"go fish,\" said Brian Cladoosby, chairman of the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community. The invitation for anyone to catch as many of the fugitive fish as possible was, at best, ineffectual, he said.\nSwinomish rights to fish in the Puget Sound are guaranteed by historic treaties and their livelihoods depend on commercial fisheries.\n\"Many native salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest are already endangered or threatened. Putting this many Atlantic salmon, an invasive species, into the ecosystem cannot be good for it,\" Cladoosby said.\nAtlantic salmon are seen as particularly suitable for farming, due to their quick growth and disease resistance.\nCompany spokesman Chuck Brown said there was no evidence  Atlantic salmon posed a threat to wild Pacific salmon stocks. He added that Cooke had offered to fund a two-year study examining the impact of the farmed fish.\nCooke said it quickly took steps to contain the breach and gained emergency permits from government officials to recapture escapees. \nFindings from a state investigation are expected to be released in November, said Cori Simmons, spokeswoman for the state Department of Natural Resources.\n\n
