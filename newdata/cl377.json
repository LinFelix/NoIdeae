Rowley declined to say if the suspected bomber had\nbeen on the train, saying it was a live investigation.\nPrime Minister Theresa May called the incident a \"cowardly\nattack\" and said the national threat level had been raised a\nnotch to its highest level, \"critical\".\nThe Islamic State militant group, which has said it was\nbehind several attacks on Western cities in recent years,\nincluding two attacks in London and one in Manchester this year,\nclaimed responsibility through its news agency, Amaq.\nIt was impossible to verify the claim, for which Amaq\noffered no evidence. Western intelligence officials have\nquestioned similar claims in the past, saying that while Islamic\nState's jihadist ideology may have inspired some attackers,\nthere is scant evidence that it has orchestrated attacks.\nPictures taken at the scene showed a slightly charred white\nbucket with a supermarket freezer bag on the floor of one train\ncarriage. The bucket, still intact, was in flames and there\nappeared to be wires coming out of the top.\n\"I was on second carriage from the back. I just heard a kind\nof 'whoosh'. I looked up and saw the whole carriage engulfed in\nflames making its way towards me,\" Ola Fayankinnu, who was on\nthe train, told Reuters.\n\"There were phones, hats, bags all over the place and when I\nlooked back I saw a bag with flames.\"\nCharlie Craven said he had just got on the train when the\ndevice exploded.\n\"Literally within three seconds of putting your bag down,\nthe doors just closing, we hear a loud explosion,\" he told\nReuters. \"I looked around and saw this massive fireball ...\ncoming down the carriage.\"\nHe said terrified passengers fled, fearing a second\nexplosion or a gunman, with people being knocked to the ground\nand crushed in the stampede to escape.\nOutside the station, a woman was carried off on a stretcher\nwith her legs covered in a foil blanket while others were led\naway swathed in bandages. The health service said 29 people had\nbeen treated in hospital, many suffering from flash burns.\n\n\"SPECULATION UNHELPFUL\"\nIn 2005, 52 people were killed when four British Islamists\ncarried out suicide bomb attacks on three London underground\ntrains and a bus, and this year Britain has suffered four\nattacks that killed a total of 36 people.\n\"Another attack in London by a loser terrorist,\" U.S.\nPresident Donald Trump said on Twitter. \"These are sick and\ndemented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be\nproactive!\"\nMay, who returned to London to chair a meeting of Britain's\nemergency response committee, said police and security services\nwere working to track down those responsible.\nAsked about Trump's tweet, she replied: \"I never think it's\nhelpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing\ninvestigation.\"\nOthers were more directly critical of Trump. \"True or not -\nand I'm sure he doesn't know - this is so unhelpful from leader\nof our ally and intelligence partner,\" May's former chief of\nstaff Nick Timothy said on Twitter.\nA U.S. law enforcement official and a U.S. intelligence\nsource, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the attack\nmight well have been carried out in response to recent Islamic\nState video messages urging would-be militants to attack trains\nand other public transport.\nOne of the officials said the device \"doesn’t look very\nprofessionally built\" and said its rudimentary design suggested\nthe attack had been carried out by someone inspired by Islamic\nState propaganda rather than by a well-trained cell.\nProfessor Hans Michels, an explosives expert from Imperial\nCollege London, said the device appeared to have largely failed.\n\"The flash flame reported suggests that the ‘explosion’ was\nonly partly successful,\" he said. \"I must speculate that either\nthe mixture was not of the right composition or that the\nignition system was inadequate or not properly placed.\"\nUK security services believe those behind some of the\nmilitant incidents in Britain this year were probably acting\nalone and radicalised by online material.\nIn March, a man drove a car into pedestrians on London's\nWestminster Bridge killing four, before he stabbed a policeman\nto death outside parliament.\nA further 22 people were killed in a suicide bombing at a\npop concert in Manchester in May and the following month three\nIslamist militants drove into pedestrians on London Bridge\nbefore stabbing people at nearby restaurants and bars, killing\neight.\nIn June, a van was driven into worshippers near a mosque in\nnorth London which left one man dead.\nFigures released on Thursday showed there had been a record\nnumber of terrorism-related arrests in Britain in the past year.\nIn the three years until March this year, police foiled 13\npotential attacks, Rowley said this week. But the next 17 weeks\nsaw the four attacks in London and Manchester, while the\nauthorities thwarted six others.\n(Additional reporting by Kate Holton, Mark Hosenball, Elizabeth\nPiper, Paul Sandle,
