They just don't. Trying to do both is like trying to do two full-time jobs. There are guys who have no business being in school, but they're here because this is the path to the NFL. There's no other way. Then there's the other side that says raise the SAT eligibility requirements. OK, raise the SAT requirement at Alabama and see what kind of team they have. You lose athletes and then the product on the field suffers.\n\nTiny slices of that quote became the talk of national college sports media for about three days afterward. Nevermind that Rosen had already established a track record of speaking his mind, and doing so in paragraphs, rather than phrases; something about a current \"student-athlete\" criticizing the modern American university-sports complex really struck a nerve. BE GRATEFUL and STOP WHINING and other point-missing dominated the conversation until everyone found something new to get mad about.\n\nSunday night, Rosen stuck to sports, and in our might-makes-right culture, the microphone is now his until someone pries it out of his hand. I bet you aren't the one who can take it away from him.\n\nAfter being called a SOFT WHINY MILLENNIAL COWARD, Rosen led UCLA to a 34-point comeback over Texas A&M, the second biggest rally in the recorded history of America's oldest organized major sporting association (2006 Michigan State over Northwestern was a 35-point swing).\n\nThe supposed OVERRATED BIGSHOT THANKLESS LIBTARD dumped 491 total passing yards on a blue-chip Aggie defense. The alleged CREAMPUFF CRYBABY LOUDMOUTH BABY did so despite the first half going like this, as UCLA's run game and protection and defense flailed:\n\nIt was a damn torrent, and yes, it was like a warp-tempo version of the other comeback you're thinking of.\n\nIn America, the one who holds the gold or the big stick or the gun or the game ball is the one who speaks loudest. Neither you nor I nor Rosen made that rule, but that's the way our country works. So because he's just obliterated his critics on the field, the floor is now his, by the natural law we've forged for ourselves.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
