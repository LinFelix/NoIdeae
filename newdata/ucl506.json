The U.S. Justice Department also cleared him on March 4, 2015. Wilson is no longer with the Ferguson Police Department.\n\nERIC GARNER\nAccused of illegally selling individual cigarettes, Eric Garner, 43, died on July 17, 2014 after he was arrested in New York City's Staten Island borough and put into a chokehold by New York City Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is white. The encounter was captured on video.\nSeveral street protests in New York and other cities followed news of the killing, and again five months later, on Dec. 3, when a grand jury did not return an indictment against Pantaleo, who is still with the NYPD.\n\nFREDDIE GRAY\nIn Baltimore, 25-year-old Freddie Gray was arrested on April 12, 2015 after police said he fled the scene unprovoked in a high crime area while in possession of an illegal switchblade. \nAfter being transported in a police van, Gray was hospitalized unconscious and died on April 19 of what was determined to be a neck injury.\nGray's injury and death while in police custody sparked several days of protests and rioting in Baltimore, prompting  Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake to set a week-long curfew. As a result, the Baltimore Orioles were forced to postpone two home games against the Chicago White Sox, and played a third on April 29 in an empty stadium, unprecedented in Major League Baseball.\nSix Baltimore police officers, including three who are black, where charged with Gray's death. None were convicted, and the Justice Department subsequently decided not to bring charges against them.\n\nTERENCE CRUTCHER\nWhile standing near his car in the middle of a street in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Sept. 16, 2016, 40-year-old Terence Crutcher was fatally shot by police officer Betty Shelby, who is white. The shooting was captured on video from several angles.\nThe killing touched off protests in Tulsa and led the Tulsa County district attorney to charge Shelby with first-degree manslaughter on Sept. 22. \nEarlier this year, on May 17, a jury acquitted Shelby of the charge. Shelby, who had been placed on administrative duty since the shooting, resigned from the Tulsa police force on July 14.\n\nKEITH LAMONT SCOTT\nIn North Carolina, 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott was shot dead on Sept. 20, 2016 by Charlotte police Officer Brentley Vinson, who is also black. Police said Scott got out of his car carrying a handgun and refused orders to drop it. Scott's wife, who was present, disputed the account.\nThe shooting sparked both peaceful protests and violent riots in Charlotte over two nights, resulting in several injuries and one death.\nThe district attorney determined on Nov. 30, 2016 that Vinson \"acted lawfully,\" and Charlotte-Mecklenburg police Chief Kerr Putney later ruled that he acted in accordance with department policy. Last month, a civilian review board in the city split evenly over Putney's decision, the first time in the board's 20-year history that it did not agree with the chief.\n\n (Reporting by Peter Szekely
