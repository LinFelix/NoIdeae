The series of anti-Trump tweets have landed Hill at the center of disciplinary action over at ESPN. The network was quick to distance itself from Hill's opinions after a White House spokesperson referred to the incident as a \"fireable offense\". Variety reports on Friday, ESPN president John Skipper released a statement addressing the controversy:\n\n\"In light of recent events, we need to remind ourselves that we are a journalistic organization and that we should not do anything that undermines that position.\"\n\n\"[W]e have social media policies which require people to understand that social platforms are public and their comments on them will reflect on ESPN. At a minimum, comments should not be inflammatory or personal.\"\n\n\"We had a violation of those standards in recent days and our handling of this is a private matter. As always, in each circumstance we look to do what is best for our business.\"\n\nThinkProgress now reports that ESPN allegedly made moves to replace the SportsCenter anchor with another black host in the 6 pm time slot, and when they refused, the show was forced to go on with Hill as usual. A source close to the situation revealed that initially the network wanted to keep Hill off the air on Wednesday evening, but co-anchor Michael Smith refused to go on without her. Additionally sources report producers reached out to two other black ESPN hosts, Michael Eaves and Elle Duncan, asking them to fill in for both hosts, but they refused.\n\nESPN refutes these claims and senior vice president for news and information at SportsCenter, Rob King expressed to ThinkProgress that although the network had a few rough days, ultimately Hill and Smith are the best folks for the job:\n\n\"Yesterday was a hard and unusual day, with a number of people interpreting the day without a full picture that happened\".\n\n\"In the end, ultimately, Michael and Jemele appearing on the show last night and doing the show the way they did is the outcome we always desired.\"\n\nHill hasn't shared any intention of apologizing for her tweets, but did express appreciation for the support of her fellow journalists with a photo she posted on Wednesday:\n\nShe didn't recant her thoughts, but did note that she should've been clear to separate her personal beliefs from her position at ESPN:\n\nOf course, Donald Trump's Twitter fingers couldn't wait to comment on the whole situation:\n\nESPN is paying a really big price for its politics (and bad programming). People are dumping it in RECORD numbers. Apologize for untruth!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2017","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
