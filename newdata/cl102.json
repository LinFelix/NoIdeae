Those charges would have to wait until he leaves to be taken to the courts.\nThe corruption charges presented on Thursday were the second Temer could face.\nA first set of criminal charges saying that Temer took bribes from meatpacker JBS SA was blocked in August by his allies in the lower house of Congress, which has the power to decide whether a president should stand trial by the Supreme Court.\nTemer's lawyers said the second set of charges should return to the prosecutor's general office for reevaluation.
