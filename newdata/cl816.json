For me it is one game at a time,\" the former Real Madrid manager told the BBC.\n\n\"It is a very competitive league and we are learning from that.\n\n\"This group of players works very hard. Sometimes we have some problems, but with the chances we can create we know they can give us the points.\"\n\nAfter Xherdan Shaqiri cancelled out Christian Atsu's opener, it was left to defender Lascelles to again prove the match-winner for Newcastle.\n\nThe captain headed in a Matt Ritchie corner for the second straight match following last weekend's carbon-copy act against Swansea City.\n\n\"We had a lot of chances and it was a great intensity from the boys from the start,\" Lascelles told Sky Sports.\n\n\"Ultimately it is three wins and we are really pleased, but today it could have been three, four, five goals.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
