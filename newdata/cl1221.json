Both were killed in the Manchester arena bomb attack in May.\n\nIt aims to support those who have a passion in performance or sport, to nurture their talents through the help of bursaries.\n\nMrs Lines said: \"I was lucky enough to gain a place by going through the ballot, so I wasn't running for anyone.\n\n\"Caroline is a friend of the family and we knew about the Trust they were setting up and she asked me whether I would consider running for the Trust.\n\n\"I think it is such a fantastic idea. My daughter runs for an athletic club and we know how expensive being part of a sport or dancing can be.\n\n\"Darcy is taking part in the junior run and when we mentioned to her about raising money for the Trust she said yes straight away.\"\n\nOn Saturday Darcy will be taking on the 1.5K course from Newcastle, across to Gateshead then back to Newcastle.\n\nHer mum, Claire, will run from Newcastle to South Shields in the 13.1 mile event on Sunday.\n\nClaire added: \"We have both been out training. Last year I managed to do the run in two hours, 26 minutes - so this year I am hoping for two hours.\n\n\"We both feel so honoured to have been asked to run for such a worthy cause.\"\n\nTo sponsor Claire and Darcy, visit www.justgiving.com\/crowdfunding\/claire-lines","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 19:33:22.681"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 19:33:22.294","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|lrVvEAtPUwtBBatk6hYrJ1z7vrw=|PcMHS7OpyRilI2NX4DF7j0RDLC1iHtIbXh5d2lNpn4X3WORA5xPRAw==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5df0fb2-0a15-3f38-b44e-c7cc3463ae0b\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.903,"name":"Human Interest"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5df0fb2-0a15-3f38-b44e-c7cc3463ae0b\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5df0fb2-0a15-3f38-b44e-c7cc3463ae0b\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5df0fb2-0a15-3f38-b44e-c7cc3463ae0b\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/8802cc97-e83a-3d7d-b3b5-b3efb8e1d8de","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Fiction","importance":"1","originalValue":"Fiction"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5df0fb2-0a15-3f38-b44e-c7cc3463ae0b\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5df0fb2-0a15-3f38-b44e-c7cc3463ae0b\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/4f20fdbb-79f3-350b-91f1-d1ba27fc40ce","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Claire Bennet","importance":"1","originalValue":"Claire Bennet"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5df0fb2-0a15-3f38-b44e-c7cc3463ae0b\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5df0fb2-0a15-3f38-b44e-c7cc3463ae0b\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/5406d251-ddae-3508-b525-9d67bd22d023","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Claire Littleton","importance":"1","originalValue":"Claire Littleton"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5df0fb2-0a15-3f38-b44e-c7cc3463ae0b\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5df0fb2-0a15-3f38-b44e-c7cc3463ae0b\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/cf60b243-308c-3770-812a-61a0330a3f95","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Plot narrative)","importance":"2","originalValue":"Plot narrative)"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5df0fb2-0a15-3f38-b44e-c7cc3463ae0b\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Commercial REITs -
