During an interaction session here, she was asked about her opinion on feminism and why some people called her a 'man-hater' after her fiery interviews in the last couple of weeks.\n\nIn response to that, Kangana said: \"No, I am not a man-hater for sure... I think feminism is something... a sorry state to be in any society. The gender equality should be there, where feminism doesn't need to act like a medicine on inequality.\n\n\"We should not have feminists, we shouldn't have all these things... We shouldn't have feminism in society.\"\n\nKangana has always made some unusual choices in films - be it Fashion, Tanu Weds Manu, Queen or Simran - and how bold she is about making statements on her struggles in her personal and professional life.\n\nAsked about her courage, Kangana said: \"See, a person's opinion shouldn't have to do anything with her profession. My profession should not determine my voice as an individual. I think before an actress, I am a woman and a citizen of this country with a free voice, and my voice should be free from all baggage.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
