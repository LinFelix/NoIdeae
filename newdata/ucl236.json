LOUIS, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters poured\ninto St. Louis' streets and some scuffles broke out as they\nvoiced their anger after a Missouri judge on Friday ruled a\nwhite former St. Louis police officer was not guilty of murder\nin the 2011 shooting of a black man.\nWith the National Guard on standby in case of violence,\nauthorities appealed to protesters to march peacefully in a\nstate where racially charged clashes in the nearby city of\nFerguson spawned the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014.\nPolice said a few protesters threw rocks and water bottles,\nwhile witnesses and video showed officers used pepper spray on\nat least five people about a block from the courthouse. About 50\nriot police were on hand, blocking a ramp to a nearby highway.\nJason Stockley, 36, was acquitted of first-degree murder for\nkilling Anthony Lamar Smith, 24. The former policeman said Smith\nfled in his car when he attempted to arrest him on drug charges.\nStockley and his partner chased Smith, who was shot five\ntimes in his car. The former policeman thought Smith had a gun,\ndefense attorneys said. A gun was found in the car but\nprosecutors argued Stockley planted the weapon and the gun had\nonly Stockley's DNA on it.\nAfter the verdict, about 600 protesters marched in downtown\nSt. Louis, chanting \"No justice, no peace\" and \"Hey hey! Ho ho!\nThese killer cops have got to go!\"\nSome protesters held signs that read \"Black Lives Matter\"\nand \"No more racist killer cops.\"\nLater in the evening, a group of about 300 protesters moved\nfrom the courthouse to the city's popular restaurant\nneighborhood, the Central West End.\n\"I’m sad, I’m hurt, I’m mad,” the Reverend Clinton Stancil\nof the Wayman AME Church in St. Louis said by telephone. “We\nhaven’t made any progress since Ferguson, that’s clear. Cops can\nstill kill us with impunity.\"\nStockley's attorney, Neil Bruntrager, said the ex-officer on\nFriday was relieved and would seek to rebuild his life. “It’s\nbeen a long road for him,” Bruntrager said.\nJudge Timothy Wilson's ruling said the state had not proven\nmurder beyond a reasonable doubt or even a lesser charge such as\ninvoluntary manslaughter.\nThe judge also doubted the prosecution's claim the gun was\nplanted and wrote, \"Finally, the court observes, based on its\nnearly 30 years on the bench, that an urban heroin dealer not in\npossession of a firearm would be an anomaly.\"\nThe comment sparked outrage by protesters on the street and\non social media.\nWilson declined to comment.\n'THIS AIN'T RIGHT'\nIn recent years grand juries have declined to charge\nofficers involved in the 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown,\n18, which set of nights of violent protest in Ferguson, and the\nchoking death of Eric Garner, 43, in New York. Baltimore police\nofficers also were not convicted in the case of Freddie Gray,\nwho died from a broken neck suffered in a police van in 2015.\nBrown's father, Michael Brown Sr., voiced his frustration\nafter Friday's verdict.\n\"You all know this ain't right and you all continue to do\nthis to us,\" he told a St. Louis Fox television station. \"Like\nwe don't mean nothing, like we're rats, trash, dogs in the\nstreets. Right now, I'm praying for my city because my people\nare tired of this.\"\nBen Crump, an attorney for the Brown family, said the\ndecision would only widen the \"chasm of mistrust\" between law\nenforcement and minority communities.\n\"This decision will outrage many,” he told Reuters. “You see\nthis happen over and over again.”\nProsecutor Kimberly Gardner said she was disappointed with\nthe verdict and called on protesters to avoid violence.\n“I understand the verdict has created anger and frustration\nfor many in our community,\" she told reporters at the\ncourthouse. \"I am frustrated as well. Destruction of our\ncommunity is not the answer.\"\nSmith tried to flee from Stockley on Dec. 20, 2011,\nfollowing an alleged drug deal, authorities said. During the\npursuit, Stockley could be heard saying on an internal police\ncar video he was going to kill Smith, prosecutors said.\nAt Stockley's direction, the driver of the police car\nslammed into Smith's vehicle and they came to a stop, court\ndocuments said. Stockley then approached Smith's car and shot\nhim five times with his service weapon.\nStockley waived his right to a jury trial, allowing the\njudge to decide. He left the St. Louis Metropolitan Police\nDepartment in 2013 and was arrested last year.\nSmith's family settled a lawsuit against the city for\n$900,000 in 2013, Watkins said.\n(Additional reporting
