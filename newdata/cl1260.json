The Daily Beast reported that the process appeared to be automated. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA reporter for BuzzFeed uncovered a similar channel for appealing to racists through Google, which allows buyers to narrows ad campaigns by pairing ads with certain search terms. Entering potential phrases generated suggestions to have ads accompany searches like \"Jewish control of banks\".\n\nSolar Technology in the UK + show all Solar Technology in the UK 1\/7\n\nRoofs tiled with photovoltaic solar energy panels receive maximum sunlight exposure in Dyfi Eco Park, Machynlleth, Wales.

Prior to purging the offensive terms, Google already wielded the power to nix ads that were paired with derogatory terms and yanked thousands.\n\n\"Our goal is to prevent our keyword suggestions tool from making offensive suggestions, and to stop any offensive ads appearing,\" senior vice president of advertising, Sridhar Ramaswamy, said in a statement.\n\n\"We have language that informs advertisers when their ads are offensive and therefore rejected. In this instance, ads didn't run against the vast majority of these keywords, but we didn't catch all these offensive suggestions. That's not good enough and we're not making excuses.\"\n\nCES 2017: A round-up of some of the best technology\n\nWhile technology platforms have generally tried to avoid restricting content as long as it does not cross into directly advocating violence, Silicon Valley companies have moved assertively to sever ties with white supremacist groups and users after a protester was killed outside a neo-Nazi rally in Virginia.\n\nFacebook's ad sales methods have also come under scrutiny after the social media platform said it had sold thousands of divisive ads to false Russian-linked accounts during the 2016 election.\n\nMore about: Google Twitter Facebook Reuse content","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
