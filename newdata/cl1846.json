Transferring or relocating is possible for some families but difficult or impossible for many of those in most need of help.\n\nThe disparity in funding and segregation by wealth, race and ethnicity in the poorer areas are shifting support and funding to schools where the supposed beneficiaries cannot follow.\n\nThis de facto segregation reverses diversity, a primary necessity for social and economic justice.\n\nSome of the purported goals of privatization have merit but could be accomplished by the public schools. Instead, the state imposes rules and expensive, pointless tests that undermine public schools, then uses the contrived failures to justify funding for privatization.\n\nNow with Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, it's apparent the GOP, advocate of small government and local control, sees education as a business model, not an institution for the betterment of society.\n\nJames Weatherspoon St. Cloud\n\nDig deeper to learn what unions do\n\nRegarding Thomas Evans' column, \"Why I'm joining a union today,\" in the Sept. 4 Sentinel: Evans' trust in unions would be amusing if it weren't so dangerous. I advise him to do a bit of research before forming such an important opinion.\n\nThe first fact he would discover is that unions are for unions -- not workers. Labor is simply the raw material unions use to create and increase their power. He would also discover that unions do not create wealth for workers, but rather siphon off the wealth created by others. Private-sector unions have been in decline for years because there are limits on how much money can be extracted before economic consequences take hold.\n\nFor proof of this, one need only review the history of John L. Lewis' coal miners strikes. Further proof can be found in the steel industry strikes. History shows that when unions secured wages higher than what would have been gotten in a free market based on supply and demand, hundreds of thousands of union members lost their jobs. As the saying goes, there ain't no free lunch.\n\nI commend Evans for his work ethic and development of the \"soft skills\" so important in career advancement. I believe that will stand him in good stead in the private sector without a union.\n\nHowever, if Evans remains determined to join one, I recommend that he consider a public-sector union. Government workers unions are thriving, and there is a free lunch there: It's provided by the taxpayer.\n\nDavid S. Robinson Orlando Sentinel Editorial Advisory Board member from Mount Dora\n\nSo long, America as we know it\n\nI have always been proud of my country and honored to be an American. I am concerned about the future of this nation. I remember when schools taught us to respect the accomplishments of entrepreneurs like Vanderbilt, Ford, Rockefeller, Carnegie and others. Now we are taught that people like Bill Gates are greedy.\n\nIn the past, movies and television shows championed strong families and smart men with integrity. Now the entertainment industry seems to be demonizing family values and the importance of a father figure. Many of the men on television are depicted as ignorant or they are in love with another man. There are few strong families.\n\nThere is a concerted effort to split Americans into subgroups and pit them against each other. Instead of \"the great melting pot,\" we have come up with the destructive concept of multiculturalism. Schools do not teach civic duty, discipline and respect. If we allow this to continue, America as we know it will be lost forever.\n\nLoy Bates Kissimmee","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
