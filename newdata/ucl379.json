Economists polled by Reuters had forecast\nretail sales nudging up 0.1 percent.\nLooking ahead, the market is now focused on next week's\nFederal Open Market Committee meeting, in which the Fed is\nexpected to start reducing its balance sheet. There is, however,\nzero expectation for an interest rate hike.\n\"The Fed's tone and stance during next week's FOMC statement\nand press conference will play a major role in setting\nexpectations for interest rates, the Fed's balance sheet\nreduction plans, and the U.S. dollar going forward,\" said James\nChen, head of research at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.\nSterling, meanwhile, slammed the dollar as well, after  a\nBank of England policymaker opened the door for a possible rate\nincrease in the coming months. That helped push the pound to its\nhighest since the results of last June's vote to leave the\nEuropean Union, putting it on track for its best week against\nthe dollar since October 2009.\nCurrency traders also brushed off the latest missile fired\nby North Korea in a volatile day of trading on Friday.\nThe dollar initially dipped against the safe-haven yen after\nNorth Korea fired a missile early on Friday that flew over\nJapan's northern island of Hokkaido far over into the Pacific\nOcean.\nHowever, the yen's fall against the dollar on Friday raised\nquestions about investors' willingness to buy Japanese assets\nwhen Japan is in North Korea's firing line.\nIn late trading, the dollar rose 0.6 percent to 110.88 yen,\nposting its best weekly percentage gain since November.\nBritain's pound, meanwhile surged above $1.36 on Friday.\nSterling had already recorded its best day since April on\nThursday, after investors brought forward their rate hike bets\nfollowing the Bank of England's signal that it would tighten\nsoon.\nIt built on those gains on Friday after BoE policymaker\nGertjan Vlieghe said \"the appropriate time for a rise in Bank\nRate might be as early as in the coming months.\"\nThe euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.1940, staying below\na 2-1\/2-year high set last week. That pushed the dollar index to\n91.868, down 0.3 percent on the day.\n(Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Nick\nZieminski)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
