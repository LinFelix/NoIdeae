with broader NAFTA comments)\nBy Frank Jack Daniel and Adriana Barrera\nMEXICO CITY, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Trade between the United\nStates and Mexico would not end if the North American Free Trade\nAgreement (NAFTA) was terminated, Mexico's foreign minister said\non Friday, after a new U.S. plan emerged to build a five-year\nsunset provision into the treaty.\nIn the shadow of repeated threats to scrap the deal by U.S.\nPresident Donald Trump and his officials, Mexico, Canada and the\nUnited States have set an ambitious goal to renegotiate the\n23-year-old trade pact within the next few months.\nForeign Minister Luis Videgaray said currently about half of\nMexico's trade with the United States did not use NAFTA\nchannels, and that if the deal were to end the tariffs it would\nface would average 3 percent - not enough to halt trading.\n\"Mexico is much bigger than NAFTA,\" Videgaray said in an\ninterview with Reuters.\n\"If the negotiation does not go well, it would not be the\nend of trade between Mexico and the United States...There would\nbe no leap into the abyss,\" he said, arguing that World Trade\nOrganization tariffs would govern trade post-NAFTA.\nHe also mentioned that Mexico could put higher tariffs on\nU.S. products, noting that apples from Arizona could face a 50\npercent tariff to enter Mexico without NAFTA.\nVidegaray has said that Mexico would walk away from the\ntalks if Trump followed through on a threat to trigger a 180-day\ncountdown to scrap NAFTA as a negotiating tactic.\nThe three countries are due to sit down for a third round of\ntalks in Ottawa, Canada on Sept. 23.\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Thursday said the United\nStates was seeking to add a five-year sunset provision to NAFTA\nto provide a regular, \"systematic re-examination\" of the pact.\nRoss argued it was needed because forecasts for U.S. export\nand job growth when NAFTA took effect in 1994 were \"wildly\noptimistic\" and failed to live up to expectations.\nSuch a clause means NAFTA would automatically end after five\nyears unless renewed.\nVidegaray said the idea of a sunset clause was unnecessary,\nsince the pact's members can already trigger a renegotiation or\nleave it at any time, and noted that neither Mexico nor Canada\nhad formally received such a proposal.\n\"There is no strict need to have this exit mechanism since\nthe treaty already has a much more flexible exit mechanism,\" he\nsaid. \"It seems redundant, or strange to add a date of every\nfive years.\"\nIn an attempt to reduce its dependence on U.S. trade, Mexico\nhas been doubling down on its open trade model, and is currently\ntrying to secure more access to the European Union, Brazil,\nIsrael, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, among others.\nDespite the tensions over trade and repeated barbs by Trump,\nsome aspects of the U.S.-Mexico relationship have been\nblossoming, including defense cooperation.\nOn Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Mexico\nto take part in Independence Day celebrations.\nBoth Videgaray and Mattis said the two countries shared\ncommon concerns about issues that include drug trafficking in\nMexico but also drug consumption in the United States that fuels\nthe illicit industry.\n(Reporting by Frank Jack Daniel and Adriana Barrera; Editing by\nDave Graham and Lisa
