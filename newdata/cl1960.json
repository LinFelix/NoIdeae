There were shots from (Congolese forces) and the police on asylum seekers,\" she said.\n\nThe death toll is likely to worsen, Marchal said.\n\nThe Congolese government, the UN refugee agency and the UN peacekeeping mission in Congo \"have deployed teams on site to shed light on everything that happened,\" she said.\n\nThe UN refugee agency said it was \"shocked and saddened over the violent death of numerous Burundian nationals -- among them likely refugees and asylum seekers.\" It called for an investigation.\n\nBurundi's foreign minister, Alain Aime Nyamitwe, on Twitter asked Congo and UN officials for an explanation of the shootings.\n\nResidents in the area said the killings occurred after some Burundian refugees went to the bureau of intelligence in Kamanyola to inquire about four detained refugees. Congolese soldiers responded with gunfire when some of the refugees hurled stones, said refugee Aline Nduwarugira.\n\nAnother witnesses, Alfred Rukungo, said Congolese soldiers continued shooting into the crowd even after some refugees were wounded.\n\nMore than 100 people were injured in the incident, according to Bertin Bisimwa, chief of Kamanyola.\n\nCongo is home to thousands of Burundian refugees. Many fled political violence at home in 2015, when President Pierre Nkurunziza successfully pursued a disputed third term amid deadly protests.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
