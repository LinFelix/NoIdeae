This new service will offer customers the opportunity to create their own custom shoes, choosing from the models of a rich \"DIY\" Catalog, re-organized and optimized by Virtual Fitting and AI tech, which can predict style preferences and the perfect individual user fit, consequently recommending specific products that best fit the customers' needs.\n\nThe collaboration was born at a meeting between the founders of the two startups during an event organized by Intesa SanPaolo. Andrea Carpineti, CEO of startup DIS, a Direct to Consumer brand that has long been using an innovative 3D configurator both online and in store for customized footwear; whilst speaking with Andrey Golub, co-founder and CEO of ELSE Corp, who during the event presented the progress of his technological startup; was convinced that it is time for DIS to implement the next strategy: to introduce new 3D foot scanning technologies to propose to the public a more attractive Customer Experience, accelerating the changes in the custom footwear market.\n\nELSE Corp, operating in the \"Virtual Retail\" (no stock retail) realm, is developing a technological platform called E.L.S.E.™, an acronym for \"Exclusive Luxury Shopping Experience.\" It offers a new 3D Customer Experience using disruptive technologies for Fashion & Retail such as Cloud SaaS Platform, 3D CAD and most recently, Artificial Intelligence. It is thanks to the work on Artificial Intelligence that the startup's team ELSE.ai has been selected to participate in the IBM Watson AI XPRIZE, an AI and cognitive computing competition challenging teams globally to develop and demonstrate how humans can collaborate with powerful AI technologies to tackle the world's grand challenges.\n\nSo begins a new chapter in the lives of the two startups, who will now work strictly together in the knowledge that united they can conquer a large slice of the custom footwear market, being the forerunners of this new idea, showing other companies how to expand their technological and innovative horizons.\n\nAt theMICAM, the International Footwear Fair, which will take place in Milan from September 17th to 20th, the two startups will present their innovative technologies, yet not integrated but already cross-referenced: ELSE Corp with its stand dedicated to the launch of their E.L.S.E. based else.shoes™ platform, showcasing the idea of 3D Retail Revolution while attracting the attention of potential customers and partners; and DIS-Design Italian Shoes, who will show how they combine their traditional handmade manufacturing techniques with the latest technologies, providing customers with services so each shoe created tells a different and unique story. The fair is, therefore, a milestone for both startups in achieving their goals.\n\nELSE Corp\n\nELSE Corp, a Virtual Retail company, is an Italian B2B startup founded in Milan in 2014, that is developing E.L.S.E. (Exclusive Luxury Shopping Experience), a new customer experience through an innovative SaaS cloud platform for Virtual Retail, Virtual Commerce, and Hybrid & Distributed Manufacturing. Incubated by Polihub Startup District & Incubator by Politecnico Foundation of Milan, it has joined various startup programs such as Microsoft, BizSpark Plus, SAP Focus and IBM Global Entrepreneur. ELSE Corp was the first Italian startup to be certified by Early Metrics UK, a rating agency for startups and innovative SMEs. www.else-corp.com\n\nDIS - Design Italian Shoes\n\nDIS - Design Italian Shoes, is a custom-made shoe brand based in Le Marche, the so called 'Italian Shoe Valley', with more than 100 years of shoe handcrafting traditions. Though the innovative 3D configurator, DIS allows customers to choose any shoe model, personalize it in just a few clicks and have them custom-made in Italy in just 10 days. A truly creative process, that allows customer to play with millions of combinations of materials, laces, soles and finishes, creating the perfect shoe for every personality, occasion and style. DIS was founded in 2013 from the intuition of Andrea and Francesco Carpineti and Michele Luconi and their desire to boost the artisanal manufacturing traditions through digital technology. Today, DIS has become a world reknowned company, distributed in several shops and boutiques across Europe, the United States, China and Japan. www.dis.shoes","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
