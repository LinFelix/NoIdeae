Tell the people what you can do for them, do not spread lies.\"\n\n Uduaghan said his experience with Prof. Utomi  showed he was someone with bogus ideas  who  does not have the frame of mind for execution.\n\n \" He bragged about his reach internationally, how he was going to bring international investors and we had to partner with him to organize a business forum outside the country with Nigerians in Diaspora for us to get the investors, but he did not spend 5 minutes before he left us ;  no investor came to the state through him. \n\n\"You people should ask Prof, where is the Silicon Valley? He took us to his home town, Ibusa for the foundation laying ceremony of Silicon Valley, till date, there is nothing to show that the project has commenced .\n\n\"He has contested for the Presidency, he now wants to be the Governor but, I think he should start from his Ward, he should contest for Councillor . \n\n\"It is not good to condemn what the incumbent Governor is doing because of your ambition, rather, you should bring out your programmes and sell to the people .  Governor Okowa has done excellently well and we should join hands with him to develop the state.\" ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
