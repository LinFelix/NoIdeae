It was dry, but I was looking for some good news and thought I'd found it.\n\nThen, an hour or so after I turned off my computer, three shootings took place in north St. Louis that killed two men and gravely injured a third man and a 6-year-old boy. It's hard to keep up, but at least eight people were murdered in the city in the first two weeks of September, bringing the total for the year to 146. I trashed the editorial.\n\nExperts analyze figures looking for trends, which is worth doing, but not particularly hopeful when there's a 6-year-old boy with a gunshot wound to the head because some guys ambushed his daddy.\n\nExperts say something called \"legal cynicism\" may come into play. It's a concept that's been around academic circles for at least a decade and become part of the discussion of the so-called \"Ferguson effect\" in St. Louis following the 2014 shooting death of Michael Brown of Ferguson.\n\nHalf of the Ferguson effect was \"de-policing,\" the notion that cops had become less likely to aggressively pursue interventions in low-income, high-crime neighborhoods. The other half was legal cynicism. Here's how Richard Rosenfeld, the University of Missouri-St. Louis criminologist, defined it:\n\n\"It's a set of beliefs and attitudes in disadvantaged neighborhoods that have lost confidence in police,\" Rosenfeld said. Studies have shown that retaliatory homicides among gangs or family groups go up when confidence in the legitimacy of government goes down. As frontline representatives of government, cops get the blame.\"\n\nRosenfeld added: \"You can see big increases in homicide in a short period of time. St. Louis, Cleveland and Memphis all saw double-digit increases in one year. Do we know that was driven by retaliatory shootings? We don't know that, but retaliatory shootings make up a sizable percentage of homicides.\"\n\nAt the micro level, if a couple of guys wait for a car to pull up so they can ambush the driver and happen to shoot a 6-year-old child instead, it's hard to think it's because they've lost faith in government.\n\nBut at a macro, societal level, legal cynicism may be real. In fact, there's a historian at Ohio State University named Randolph Roth who argues that throughout American history, homicide rates rise and fall depending on how people feel about their government. It was bad after the Revolutionary War, for example, as people tried to absorb British loyalists. It was bad in the rural South after the Civil War because people were bitter about the government in Washington.\n\nIn his 2009 book \"American Homicide,\" Roth suggests that four factors help govern how high the murder rate is at a given time in our political history: political instability; loss of government legitimacy; loss of a feeling of belonging among outcast or historically oppressed groups; and loss of faith in the social hierarchy.\n\nThe worst year for murder in U.S. history was 1991, when 24,700 people were killed. George H.W. Bush was president. The Cold War ended. The United States won Operation Desert Storm in a cakewalk. All in all, a pretty good year. Except crack cocaine wars were ravaging American cities.\n\nIt was true in St. Louis, too. In absolute numbers, St. Louis' worst year for murders was 1970, with 307. Allowing for declining population, the worst year was 1993, with 267 -- a homicide rate of 69 for every 100,000 people.\n\nThe city's on pace for 206 this year, which in a city of 311,400 would be 66 for every 100,000 people. That's way too close to the record.\n\nJust 14 years ago, in 2003, the city recorded only 74 homicides. What's happened since then to spike the numbers? The same guy, Francis Slay, was mayor for nearly all of those years. George W. Bush and Barack Obama were president.\n\nWell, Ferguson happened in 2014 and Anthony Lamar Smith was killed by Officer Jason Stockley in 2011, though it didn't become a cause celebre until 2016. There were numerous other, less controversial police shootings. There is every reason to think legal cynicism is at work in large parts of St. Louis.\n\nBut so is heroin, supplied by Mexican drug cartels and craved by customers, many of them white, who got started on opioids with prescription drugs. The city houses a disproportionate percentage of the criminal population for a region of 2.8 million people. The city is home to a lot of rootless, ill-educated young men for whom trading in narcotics is a viable career choice and who have easy access to cheap stolen guns.\n\nPeople who study homicide think the problem might be getting slightly better, if only because the last two years were really awful. But as a nation and a city, we've made a collective decision that fixing it is way too hard. We ask cops to fix everything. They haven't got a chance.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
