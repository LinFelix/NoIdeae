Suddenly our severe thunderstorms seem tolerable.\n\nSome of the computer models bring Hurricane Jose perilously close to New England in 3 days. Good grief. This will wind up being the most destructive & expensive hurricane season since 2005.\n\nA run of 80s has helped with crop maturation, according to Mark Seeley. Expect 80s and a few strong\/severe T-storms later today, but a cooler front dries us out on Sunday. Warmer air returns next week, and September should wind up milder than average.\n\nAnother super-sized autumn for Minnesota? Probably.\n\n* NOAA NAM forecast map valid midday Tuesday courtesy of Tropicaltidbits.com.\n\nTwin Cities 15-Day. Look at the larger trends: cooling off Sunday and Monday, then another shot at 80F the latter half of next week before another (inevitable) cooling trend as we end the month of September. ECMWF data: WeatherBell.\n\n84-Hour Rainfall Outlook. You can see the swath of heavy rain predicted for Jose at it churns northward; a secondary bulls-eye of heavy rain over the Midwest and Upper Midwest, where some 1-2\" rains are forecast between now and midday Tuesday.\n\nPraedictix Briefing: Saturday morning, September 16, 2017:\n\n* Two distinct risks of hurricane landfall over the continental USA over the next 10 days.\n\n* Odds favor that \"Jose\" will brush Cape Cod and southern New England with tropical storm-force winds and high surf by Wednesday, but the brunt of the storm will remain offshore.\n\n* Second risk of landfall September 24-26 from a system still strengthening 700 miles east of the Windward islands. This second storm has a better chance of making a direct landfall on the USA and needs to be monitored carefully in the coming days.\n\n* We are just past the midway point of hurricane season. The threats to the USA are not over yet. The same unusually warm water that helped to spin up Harvey and Irma will spawn additional storms in the coming weeks.\n\nNo Way Jose. Here are model solutions valid next Wednesday morning, September 20. Both GFS (upper left) and ECMWF (upper right) show a strong tropical storm or Category 1-2 hurricane off the coast of New England. Even though models aren't bringing the eyewall inland, tropical-storm-force winds and moderate storm surge flooding is possible over Cape Cod, Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard by Tuesday\/Wednesday of next week. Model credit: WSI.\n\nNOAA NHC Track. Here is NOAA's official track for Jose, keeping the core\/center of the storm just offshore - but coming a little close for comfort from Long Island to Cape Cod the middle of next week.\n\nTiming Tropical Storm-Force Winds. Here is NOAA's experimental product focused on timing of sustained winds in excess of 39 mph. High winds and rough surf capable of beach erosion and flooding (especially close to high tide) is expected from the Carolinas (Sunday) to southern New England (Tuesday morning).\n\nSecond Storm to Watch. Jose makes me nervous, but I'm more concerned about a second storm forecast to approach or even strike the United States around September 25-26. Both major models (NOAA GFS and European ECMWF) suggest strong hurricanes approaching the southeast coast of the USA. Confidence levels are low, but the fact that both models show similar solutions this far out means we should all pay attention.\n\nGentle Reminder: This Is Midpoint of Hurricane Season. As the nation recovers from Harvey and Irma it's important to remember that September 10 marked the official midpoint of tropical season, the date landfall is most likely somewhere in the United Statest (corresponding to when ocean water temperatures usually peak). Hurricane frequency trails off rapidly in October, on average, but it's important not to let our guard down anytime soon. As it is, this will almost certainly be the most destructive and expensive hurricane season since 2005, the year Katrina, Rita and Wilma struck. Graphic credit: CNN.\n\nSummary: Odds favor Jose taking a track out to sea next week, but it may be a close call, with significant coastal flooding and beach erosion from the Outer Banks to Cape Cod. A second storm may approach or even strike the USA around September 25-26, with the greatest potential risk over southeastern states. Saying anything more than that would be irresponsible this far out, but we want to give our clients as much lead time as possible for preparation, risk mitigation and business continuity.

After a cool August farmers are getting some relief from the recent warm spell, according to Dr. Mark Seeley at Minnesota WeatherTalk: \"With the cold start to the month of September many farmers were concerned about corn and soybeans not reaching maturity before the first frost. The dramatic warm-up in temperatures this week (5 consecutive days with temperatures running from 6-12 degrees F warmer than normal) this concern has been mostly alleviated. Corn has matured rapidly this week, as have soybeans. In fact the degree of warm temperatures has been so persistent statewide that it has offset the cold start to the month, and now most climate stations are reporting mean September temperatures that are warmer than normal at mid-month. In addition warmer than normal temperatures are expected to prevail across Minnesota until near the end of the month. This may not only help with crop maturation, but accelerated dry-down before harvest season begins...\"\n\nFall Color Update. According to the Minnesota DNR about 25-50% of the leaves have ripened west of Duluth and up in the Red River Valley. Peak color is still a few weeks away.\n\nLa Nina Watch Issued. A cooling trend in the equatorial Pacific could tilt the odds in favor a colder winter for much of the USA, certainly colder than last winter. NOAA's Climate Prediction Center says there's a 55-60% probability of a La Nina during the Northern Hemisphere fall and winter months. Stay tuned.\n\n2-Minute Doppler Radar Loops.

An estimated 95% of Barbuda's structures are damaged, and the entire island of around 1,800 people has been evacuated. \"The damage is complete,\" says Ambassador Ronald Sanders, who has served as Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the U.S. since 2015. \"For the first time in 300 years, there's not a single living person on the island of Barbuda -- a civilization that has existed on that island for over 300 years has now been extinguished.\" According to Sanders, Irma was \"the most ferocious, cruel and merciless storm\" in the island's history. The hurricane was 378 miles wide when it descended on Barbuda, which is just 62 square miles. \"This was a huge monster,\" he says. \"The island and the people on the island had absolutely no chance...\"\n\nEastern Tennessee Air Patrol Photographer Saw \"Total Devastation\" of Hurricane Irma. A story at Knoxville News Sentinel put the damage into stark perspective: \"...Although more than a million people lost power and many structures were destroyed, Puerto Rico was spared from much worse damage as the massive hurricane just missed the island on Sept. 7. Smaller islands like St. Thomas and St. John a little to the east weren't as fortunate. \"They took the brunt of the hurricane,\" he said. \"Totally devastated. \"Taking pictures from 1,000 feet, there would be a street with 10 houses and seven or eight would have their roof gone and be down to the foundation; one or two might look fine.

You can follow him on Twitter.\n\nHow Powerful Can a Hurricane Get? Is there an upper speed limit? Turns out it's a function of water temperature, and the depth of that warm layer of water. Here's an excerpt from IFLScience: \"...Based on this mechanism then, it's reasonable to assume that the warmer the surface water is, the stronger the peak winds will be. Although there are plenty of complicating factors, and the datasets before 1970 are somewhat unreliable, it appears that the scientific basis for windier hurricanes is there. There is a link between sea surface temperatures and wind speeds, but the exact numbers have yet to be nailed down. Theoretically though, as long as the oceans warm, then there is once again no upper limit on the peak wind strength of hurricanes. Hurricanes have already pointed this out to us: Although not sustained wind, a single gust generated by 1996's Tropical Cyclone Olivia clocked in at 407 km\/h (253 mph), almost the same as those at the fringes of Jupiter's Great Red Spot...\"\n\nImage credit: \"The eye of Hurricane Jose from space.\" Copernicus\/Antti Lipponen.\n\nThe Top American Weather Model Struggled to Forecast Hurricane Irma. Overall ECMWF still did a better job. I'm rooting for the home team, but we need more research\/funding and a new approach to catch up and exceed the model accuracy of the \"Euro\" Here's an excerpt from Andrew Freedman at Mashable: \"...But in general, the European model, which is run by the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF), performed far better than the premiere U.S. model, known as the Global Forecast System (GFS). Hurricane Irma is one more in a long line of storms to shine a spotlight on problems with the GFS, particularly at intermediate to longer timescales. The issue gained prominence after Hurricane Sandy struck New Jersey in October 2012, which the European model hinted at at least a week in advance. The GFS model, however, didn't catch on to the storm's unusual track until about 5 days in advance...\"\n\nYou May Not Live in Florida or Texas, But Your Insurance Rates Could Spike Because of Hurricanes. Here are a couple of snippets from a USA TODAY article: \"You may not live in one of the areas hit by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but that doesn't mean your insurance rates will go unscathed. Motorists and homeowners throughout Texas and Florida as well as those who live anywhere from Alabama to Wyoming could see their premiums rise, as insurance companies pay out billions of dollars to customers whose properties were destroyed or damaged...People living in the areas slammed by the hurricanes are most at risk for auto and homeowners rate increases. But because insurance is handled by each state individually, people elsewhere in Texas and Florida could see a bump, too. Drivers in states adjacent to those Harvey and Irma hammered also may face rate hikes, because some insurers calculate car insurance rates regionally...\"\n\nImage credit: \"When Kyle Parry returned to his home in Lumberton, Texas, after Hurricane Harvey hit, it was a complete loss.

ZDNet has an interesting article: \"...Atmospheric science relies on a combination of data, but Capps explains that today the primary source is satellite imagery. That does not mean pretty pictures though. Satellite imagery comes in different sizes and shapes: some satellites operate in the black and white spectrum, others in infrared, some imagery can be useful to identify and measure clouds, others to measure winds over the oceans or convection. And what about sensor data; are they used as well? It depends. Capps says they are mostly used when doing predictions at a local, granular level to ground truth weather models, when using reliable equipment. Ingesting live data into weather models is another use case, but for Capps this has not proven to be that useful...\"\n\nRebuilding the Gulf Coast, Preparing For The Next Hurricane. An Op-Ed at The Philadelphia Tribune caught my eye: \"...Texas needs a 2.0 strategy; a reset, for lack of a better term. This means addressing the immediate crisis, something that should be a \"national\" priority. There should be no embarrassment about the federal government playing the leading role. That is one of the central purposes of government. Yet, more is needed. Any rebuilding plan needs to consider the existing environment and consider the possibility of future environmental disasters. How can a metropolitan area constructed on the least permeable clay-based soil ignore the need for efficient rainwater removal systems? How can multiple oil, gas and chemical plants be constructed with so few safeguards? How can so little consideration of public transportation systems be given to the fourth-largest city and metropolitan area in the U.S.? What does this mean for the population in the immediate area? What about the impact on the land? These are all questions that must be factored into the rebuilding of the eastern part of the state...\"\n\nAbandon Florida? Not Quite. But It's Time for a Retreat From Flood Zones. Asked a different way, how long do you want to keep subsidizing people to keep rebuilding in perpetual flood zones? Vox reports: \"...But the potential of strategic retreat remains largely untapped, even though sea level rise threatens to inundate 4 million to 13 million Americans this century. Florida alone is home to 1,601 \"severe repetitive loss properties\" -- properties that, on average, flood every two to three years and have been rebuilt five times with the help of taxpayer money. Harris County, Texas, which includes Houston, has close to 2,000 such properties. Analysts have already called for the government to purchase homes flooded by Harvey and Irma and restore those properties to open space. Moving to safer ground will be just one strategy among many: We'll need sea walls in some places, stricter building codes in others, and a change in where new subdivisions, highways, and hospitals are built. Attacking global warming must be part of the solution: Continued emissions of heat-trapping gases drive up the risk of rising seas...\"\n\nFile photo: NOAA.\n\nReal Estate Industry Blocks Sea-Level Warnings That Could Crimp Profits on Coastal Properties. The State has a timely article on the state regulators and realtors with their fingers in the dike: \"...These studies warn that Florida, the Carolinas and other southeastern states face the nation's fastest-growing rates of sea level rise and coastal erosion -- as much as 3 feet by the year 2100, depending on how quickly Antarctic ice sheets melt. In a recent report, researchers for Zillow estimated that nearly 2 million U.S. homes could be literally underwater by 2100, if worst-case projections become reality. This is not good news for people who market and build waterfront houses. But real estate lobbyists aren't going down without a fight.

The Verge asks an important question: how do you cool a warming planet of 7.5 billion people without making the warming worse? Here's an excerpt: \"...The world is on track to add 700 million new ACs by 2030, and 1.6 billion by 2050, largely in hot, developing countries like India and Indonesia. But the AC boom threatens to worsen the crisis it's responding to, and widen the divide between those who can afford to stay cool and those left out in the heat. Air conditioners use refrigerants, and some of the most common types -- hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs -- are powerful greenhouse gases, with thousands of times the warming potential of carbon dioxide. If HFC use continues to grow at its current pace, these chemicals could make up as much as 19 percent of emissions by 2050. International initiatives are set to phase down the worst offenders, but air conditioners contribute to climate change in a second way: they consume a tremendous amount of electricity.

The plant-to-pavement ratio of today's suburb is much higher than that of cities, but the next generation of suburbs can be even better at absorbing water. House and open community spaces are set among teardrop-shaped one-way roads, which encourage predictable, safe separation of pedestrians and moving vehicles. New suburban developments will utilize technology like autonomous electric cars (parked at solar-powered remote lots) and smart street lighting, which minimize energy use and harmful environmental impact...\"\n\nImage credit: Jun Cen.\n\nAll Roads Paved with Asphalt Trap 90% of the Sun's Heat - That's a Problem. The solution? Paint it white, according to Big Think: \"...For cities the problem is even bigger. On top of the rising temperatures, the urban heat island effect results in an additional 1.8 to 5.4°F burden for urban dwellers during the day and up to 22°F in the evenings. Concrete buildings, asphalt paved roads radiating accumulated heat throughout the night, and lack of trees contribute to the making of scorching cities. Active measures will be needed to reduce the risk of heat-related health problems. It is no surprise that LA is one of the first cities to take such measures. The urban heat island effect makes LA almost six degrees hotter than the surrounding desert, and the heat causes 60 to 70 deaths every summer.

They sit, substantively, at the heart of the biggest and most pressing issues facing the United States, and often stand on the less popular side of those: automation and inequality, trust in public life, privacy and security.
