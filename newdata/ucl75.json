She has weathered storms over mass immigration and financial and political turmoil in the European Union, while the SPD, Germany's oldest party has struggled to promote a strong rival.\n    The SPD candidate, Martin Schulz's campaign got off to a promising start, but three crushing defeats at the hands of the conservatives in regional elections, including in its heartland of North Rhine-Westphalia, knocked him off course.\n    The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party is expected to enter the national parliament for the first time.\nReuters Video News will provide extensive coverage of the campaigning in the run up to the election and comprehensive previews.  Our plans for LIVE and edited coverage follow:\nSATURDAY SEPTEMBER 16\nGERMANY\/ELECTION-COALITION BUILDING: VARIOUS - With the three smaller parties neck and neck the race is on to see who will get the coveted third place in the September 24 election. With 7.5 percent the Greens will have to battle for their dream of becoming the third strongest party, Germany's left party will unlikely form a coalition but may steal votes from other parties. The FDP is hoping to use poster boy Christian Lindner to their advantage. Should the party get in, Lindner will have his eyes on the foreign ministry. The AfD might make it into parliament, but all other parties have refused any coalition with them.\n:: REUTERS COVER\nGERMANY-ELECTION\/MERKEL: BINZ\/GRIMMEN  - German Chancellor Angela Merkel campaigns in her constituency for her conservative CDU party in Binz on the Baltic Sea island of Ruegen.
