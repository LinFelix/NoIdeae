The Obama administration imposed the restrictions in part to limit civilian casualties, and the proposed shift has raised concerns among critics that the Trump administration would open the way for broader CIA strikes in such countries as Libya, Somalia and Yemen, where the United States is fighting the Islamic State, al-Qaida or both.\n\nUntil now, the Pentagon has had the lead role for conducting airstrikes -- with drones or other aircraft -- against militants in Afghanistan and other conflict zones, such as Somalia and Libya and, to some extent, Yemen. The military publicly acknowledges its strikes, unlike the CIA, which for roughly a decade has carried out its own campaign of covert drone strikes in Pakistan that were not acknowledged by either country, a condition that Pakistan's government has long insisted on.\n\nBut the CIA's director, Mike Pompeo, has made a forceful case to Trump in recent weeks that the Obama-era arrangement needlessly limited the United States' ability to conduct counterterrorism operations, according to the current and former officials, who would not be named discussing internal debates about sensitive information. He has publicly suggested that Trump favors granting the CIA greater authorities to go after militants, though he has been vague about specifics, nearly all of which are classified.\n\n\"When we've asked for more authorities, we've been given it. When we ask for more resources, we get it,\" Pompeo said this week on Fox News.\n\nHe said that the agency was hunting \"every day\" for al-Qaida's leaders, most of whom are believed to be sheltering in the remote mountains that straddle the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\n\"If I were them, I'd count my days,\" Pompeo said.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis has not resisted the CIA proposal, administration officials said, but other Pentagon officials question the expansion of CIA authorities in Afghanistan or elsewhere, asking what the agency can do that the military cannot. Some Pentagon officials also fear that U.S. troops on the ground in Afghanistan could end up bearing the burden of any CIA strikes that accidentally kill civilians, because the agency will not publicly acknowledge those attacks. The military has also had to confront its own deadly mistakes in Afghanistan.\n\nOne senior Defense Department official said that the United States would gain little from having the CIA carry out drone strikes alongside the military, and that it raised the question of whether it was an appropriate use of covert action.\n\nA former senior administration official familiar with Pompeo's position said that he views a division of labor with the Defense Department as an abrogation of the CIA's authorities.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
