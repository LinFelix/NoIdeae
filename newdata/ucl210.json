It's up,\" he told reporters.\n\"It was a lot of fun. Common sense said you're going to lose a game.\n\"I don't think anything's over. To me, this is kind of a jumping off point. We need to move on because there's a game tomorrow and we need to be ready.\"\nDominican slugger Jose Ramirez was in hot form throughout the streak. In the 19 games he played he had a .413 batting average and smashed nine home runs, including one on Friday.\nCleveland shortstop Francisco Lindor had saved the day on Thursday with a double in the bottom of the ninth but could not produce a similar feat on Friday, striking out to end the game.\nStarting pitcher Trevor Bauer took the loss after giving up nine hits and four runs in 5.1 innings.\n\"He wasn't quite as crisp as he had been,\" said Francona.
