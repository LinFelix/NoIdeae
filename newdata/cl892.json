Students in the three main groups of mathematical sciences, experimental sciences, and human sciences and two other groups of arts and foreign languages compete against one another for the best result possible as their future is mostly determined by how they perform at the exam.\n\nWhile by comparing the figures pertaining to the number of females and males taking part at the exam over the past two years, female participants usually outnumber the male both in sitting the exam and gaining admission to the universities more males would often manage to be among the top 10 scorers in three main groups of mathematical sciences, experimental sciences, and human sciences.\n\nThe fierce contest which normally engage students since they start high school is one of the major scientific competition in the country. Many students and their parents spend four years of their resources and energies on getting ready for the university entrance exam.\n\nDespite the fact that universities have grown in number considerably over the past two decades still the cut-throat competition heats up every year as the number of seats at the top public universities are limited.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
