The recommendation comes\nmonths after the drug's approval and launch in the United\nStates, where it is sold at a list price of $9,833 for a\none-month supply and is marketed as Zejula.\nObese minority children less likely to have weight-loss\nsurgery\nObese white teens in the U.S. are much more likely obese\nblack or Hispanic teens to be treated with weight loss surgery,\naccording to a recent study. That's despite the fact that\nminority kids are disproportionately affected by rising\nchildhood obesity rates in the U.S.\nGSK's three-in-one inhaler gets positive opinion from EU\nagency\nGlaxoSmithKline said on Friday that a European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) panel has recommended the company's\nthree-in-one inhaled lung drug. GSK's once-daily triple inhaler\ncombines the drugs fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium and\nvilanterol. The idea is to use three different mechanisms to\nhelp open airways of patients with severe chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease (COPD).\nExclusive: FDA plans new compounding pharmacy policy, agency\nhead says\nThe head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on\nFriday the agency is working on a new policy that would\nencourage more compounding pharmacies to register under a law\nenacted in the wake of a deadly 2012 meningitis outbreak linked\nto one such company. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb made the\ncomments in an interview with Reuters as federal prosecutors in\nBoston prepare for the second criminal trial over contaminated\nsteroids manufactured by the now-defunct New England Compounding\nCenter (NECC).\nDrug industry on tenterhooks as Maryland price-gouging law\nnears\nAs U.S. consumer outrage grows over prescription drug\nprices, state authorities and patient advocates in Maryland are\npreparing to enforce the nation's first law designed to punish\ndrugmaker price-gouging.     The state Attorney General's office\nsaid it will field complaints and investigate \"unconscionable\nincreases\" in essential generic medicines when the closely\nwatched law takes effect Oct. 1.\nOral food challenges safe when performed in doctor's office\nOral food challenges at the doctor’s office are a safe way\nto diagnose food allergies, a U.S. study suggests. Based on\nrecords of more than 6,000 food challenge tests done in allergy\npractices in Houston, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Boston and\nIndianapolis, researchers found that only 2 percent produced a\nsevere allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis.\nAnthem to sell Obamacare health plans in Virginia counties\nthat don't offer them\nU.S. health insurer Anthem Inc said on Friday it\nplans to sell Obamacare health plans in 68 cities and counties\nin Virginia next year, covering the only remaining U.S. counties\nthat are currently without insurers offering the plans. Anthem\nsaid last month it was exiting the Obamacare market in the\nstate, but reconsidered the move after no other insurer stepped\nup to cover most of Virginia's counties.\nEuropean panel backs Janssen's psoriasis drug\nA European Medicines Agency (EMA) panel recommended the\napproval of Johnson &amp; Johnson unit Janssen's drug,\nguselkumab, for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults.\nGuselkumab, which will be marketed as Tremfya, will be used to\ntreat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, a\nchronic, autoimmune inflammatory disorder that results in\nsometimes painful, unsightly scaly and inflamed patches on the\nskin.\nDistraction isn’t only way virtual reality might ease pain\nVirtual reality games might help ease pain not just by\ndistracting players from what ails them, but also by triggering\nchanges in the brain, a recent research review suggests.\nDistraction may indeed play a role in pain relief, the review of\nsix small studies suggests. But it’s also possible that the\ntechnology could help produce changes in the nervous system when\nit’s used to help reprogram how a person responds to pain.\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
