What does this moniker tell you? For starters, Auris is the European way of saying Corolla hatchback. Touring stands for station wagon, Sports for something Toyota can only dream about, and Freestyle? Well, the latter word in the European model's name suggests a bit of plastic cladding. 11 photosThat's right, ladies and gentlemen! Toyota of Europe adds a new member to te Auris family, and its defining trait is the black plasticky trim applied to the wheel arches. And as you con notice from the way the 17-inch alloy wheels fill the arches, Toyota \"forgot\" to change anything regarding the suspension.\n\nAll in all, there's no denying the Auris Touring Sports Freestyle is more of a fashion statement rather than an all-roader. Cars than can call themselves that include the Volvo V90 Cross Country and Opel Insignia Country Tourer. And in the oily bits department, Toyota disappoints its fans once again.\n\nRegardless of engine option, the Euro-spec Auris doesn't cut the mustard when compared to the likes of the Volkswagen Golf Alltrack. The best Toyota can do is a hybrid powertrain, which is designed with frugality in mind, not performance. Going on sale in December and available as a limited-run model, the Touring Sports Freestyle has one thing it can be proud of: trunk space.\n\n1,685 liters with the rear seats folded, which is 59.5 cubic feet in U.S. currency, is cavernous enough for the lifestyle-oriented customer and the occasional trip to IKEA. Production figures and pricing haven't been released by the automaker, but it's natural to expect the Touring Sports Freestyle to carry a premium over the regular Touring without the look-at-me cladding.\n\nAcross both generations and including the hatchback body style, Toyota of Europe managed to sell more than 1.26 million such vehicles. More impressively, approximately 400,000 cars were specified with the hybrid powertrain. In 2016, the sales figure surpassed 144,000 units, which is a drop in the ocean compared to the Volkswagen Golf hatchback and longroof. 2018 Toyota Auris Touring Sports Freestyle station wagon Toyota Auris Touring Sports Freestyle Europe Toyota 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show German Combustion Engines Have Six Years To Walk The Plank Parking Guide for Dummies Headwave TAG Helmet Music and Navigation System Reviewed Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars The Dos and Don'ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part Two (Final) 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show Anticipation: 10 Debuts To Eagerly Await Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?
