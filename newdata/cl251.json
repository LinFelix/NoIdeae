Kim added the\nNorth's goal of completing its nuclear force had \"nearly reached\nthe terminal\".\nNorth Korea has launched dozens of missiles under Kim's\nleadership as it accelerates a weapons program designed to give\nit the ability to target the United States with a powerful,\nnuclear-tipped missile.\nAfter the latest missile launch on Friday, White House\nNational Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said the United States\nwas fast running out of patience with North Korea's missile and\nnuclear programs.\n\"We've been kicking the can down the road, and we're out of\nroad,\" McMaster told reporters, referring to Pyongyang's\nrepeated missile tests in defiance of international pressure.\n\"For those ... who have been commenting on a lack of a\nmilitary option, there is a military option,\" he said, adding\nthat it would not be the Trump administration's preferred\nchoice.\nAlso on Friday, the U.N. Security Council condemned the\n\"highly provocative\" missile launch by North Korea.\nIt had already stepped up sanctions against North Korea in\nresponse to a nuclear bomb test on Sept. 3, imposing a ban on\nNorth Korea's textile exports and capping its imports of crude\noil.\nThe U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley,\nechoed McMaster's strong rhetoric, even as she said Washington's\npreferred resolution to the crisis is through diplomacy and\nsanctions.\n\"What we are seeing is, they are continuing to be\nprovocative, they are continuing to be reckless and at that\npoint there's not a whole lot the Security Council is going to\nbe able to do from here, when you've cut 90 percent of the trade\nand 30 percent of the oil,\" Haley said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said that he is \"more confident\nthan ever that our options in addressing this threat are both\neffective and overwhelming.\" He said at Joint Base Andrews near\nWashington that North Korea \"has once again shown its utter\ncontempt for its neighbors and for the entire world community.\"\n\nMISSILE\nNorth Korea's latest test missile flew over Hokkaido in\nnorthern Japan on Friday and landed in the Pacific about 2,000\nkm (1,240 miles) to the east, the Japanese government said.\nIt travelled about 3,700 km (2,300 miles) in total,\naccording to South Korea's military, far enough to reach the\nU.S. Pacific territory of Guam, which the North has threatened\nbefore.\n\"The range of this test was significant since North Korea\ndemonstrated that it could reach Guam with this missile,\" the\nUnion of Concerned Scientists advocacy group said in a\nstatement. However, the accuracy of the missile, still at an\nearly stage of development, was low, it said.\nOn Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson called on\nChina, Pyongyang's only ally, and Russia to apply more pressure\non North Korea by \"taking direct actions of their own.\"\nBeijing has pushed back, urging Washington to do more to\nrein in North Korea.\n\"Honestly, I think the United States should be doing .. much\nmore than now, so that there's real effective international\ncooperation on this issue,\" China's ambassador to the United\nStates, Cui Tiankai, said on Friday.\n\"They should refrain from issuing more threats. They should\ndo more to find effective ways to resume dialogue and\nnegotiation,\" he said, while adding that China would never\naccept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state.\nNorth Korea staged its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb\ntest earlier this month and in July tested long-range\nintercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching at least\nparts of the U.S. mainland.\nLast month, North Korea fired an intermediate range missile\nthat also flew over Hokkaido into the ocean.\nWarning announcements about the latest missile blared in\nparts of northern Japan, while many residents received alerts on\ntheir mobile phones or saw warnings on TV telling them to seek\nrefuge.\nThe U.S. military said it had detected a single intermediate\nrange ballistic missile but it did not pose a threat to North\nAmerica or Guam.\nGlobal equities investors largely shrugged off the latest\nmissile test by North Korea as shares on Wall Street set new\nhighs on Friday.\nDIFFERENCES OVER DIRECT TALKS\nTrump has promised not to allow North Korea to threaten the\nUnited States with a nuclear-tipped missile.\nRussia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said the United\nStates needed to begin talks with North Korea, something that\nWashington has so far ruled out.\n\"We called on our U.S. partners and others to implement\npolitical and diplomatic solutions that are provided for in the\nresolution,\" Nebenzia told reporters after the Security Council\nmeeting. \"Without implementing this, we also will consider it as\na non-compliance with the resolution.\"\nAsked about the prospect for direct talks, a White House\nspokesman said, \"As the president and his national security team\nhave repeatedly said, now is not the time to talk to North\nKorea.\"\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in also said dialogue with\nthe North was impossible at this point. He ordered officials to\nanalyze and prepare for possible new North Korean threats,\nincluding electromagnetic pulse and biochemical attacks.\nThe United States and South Korea are technically still at\nwar with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended\nwith a truce and not a peace treaty. The North accuses the\nUnited States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of\nplanning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its\nAsian allies.\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason and Michelle
