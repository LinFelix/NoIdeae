politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are \"the Chumbawamba of British politics\", deputy leader Jo Swinson said today at the launch of the party's annual conference.\n\nShe said the party had been knocked down, but had got up again - a reference to the Burnley band's sole hit single, Tubthumping.\n\nSpeaking at the opening rally of the party's annual seaside outing in Bournemouth, she said the party would continue with it's policy of \"protecting our place in Europe.\"\n\nAnd she slammed Tory Zac Goldsmith for using a \"dog-whistling, racist, personal attack campaign\" against Sadiq Khan in his bid to become London mayor.\n\nShe said the tactics were \"unacceptable and should have no place in our democracy.\"\n\nOn the future of the Liberal Democrats , who have 12 MPs, she said they would continue to fight for \"Britain to stay modern, green and internationalist, forward-looking, open-minded, and open-hearted.\n\n\"As populist forces rise up across the world, Britain should be leading the fight to promote liberal values, not shutting ourselves off from our neighbours.\"\n\nAnd she congratulated Sarah Olney for her \"oh so sweet\" by-election victory over Goldsmith in Richmond Park in December.\n\nSix months later, in June's General Election, Goldsmith successfully won the seat back from Olney.\n\nSwinson's speech marks the start of the party's four-day Autumn conference.\n\nOutside of the official agenda, the conference is famed for its off-kilter fringe events.\n\nTonight, former leader Tim Farron will DJ at a huge disco for activists and MPs.\n\nAnd on Monday, party die-hards will join together in song for Glee Club - where popular songs are rewritten with humorous political lyrics with often controversial results.\n\nNew additions to this year's song-book include \"Hit the Road Zac\", a now slightly dated anthem celebrating Olney's by-election victory, and traditional hymn \"Guide Me Now O Great Theresa.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
