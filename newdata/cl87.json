The issue has threatened to fracture the ruling Liberal-National coalition government. \n\"Churches are free to marry whoever they like,\" Turnbull said on Friday in Canberra according to a press conference transcript.\n\"As strongly as I believe in the right of same-sex couples to marry ... Religious freedom is fundamental and it will be protected in any bill that emerges from this Parliament.\" \nReligious freedom in Australia is guaranteed under the constitution.\nThe issue has dogged Prime Minister Turnbull for two years as progressive and conservative members of his ruling coalition have pulled in opposite directions threatening his narrow Parliamentary majority.  \nAustralians have started receiving postal ballots for the poll, which runs until the end of October, and the issue is dividing the country's population of 24 million people along religious and generational lines.\nDespite securing 70 percent public support in an Ipsos\/Fairfax poll, the issue of same-sex marriage had faced a political deadlock, only broken last week when the High Court gave the all-clear for the vote. \nFissures have opened within religions as some churches urge their followers to vote against same-sex marriage, while other churches have taken a neutral stance. \nThe Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Australia's largest city, wrote to Sydney Catholic school principals on Friday afternoon, quoting Pope Francis and urging them to oppose the vote. The Bishop of Parramatta, Vincent Long Van Nguyen, however, told his parishioners in a pastoral letter that the vote was a matter of individual conscience. \nThe Anglican church, which officially opposes gay marriage, has been divided on the issue for years. \n\n (Reporting by Alison Bevege; Editing by Tom Hogue)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
