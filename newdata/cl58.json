Mental illness is a very serious issue affecting many families. My thoughts and prayers go out to Michelle's family, her wife Krista, and their child,\" O'Donnell said in a statement. \nO'Donnell and Rounds were married in a hospital ceremony in 2012, while Rounds was being treated for benign tumors and shortly after O'Donnell had suffered a heart attack. \nThe couple divorced in 2015 and were engaged in a custody battle over their then 2-year-old daughter Dakota. O'Donnell said last year that she had sole custody of their daughter. \n\n (Reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
