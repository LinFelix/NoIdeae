LOUIS, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters poured\ninto St. Louis streets on Friday, and some briefly scuffled with\npolice, after a Missouri judge acquitted a former white police\nofficer of murder in the 2011 fatal shooting of a black man\nsuspected of dealing drugs.\nWith National Guard troops placed on standby, authorities\nurged demonstrators to remain peaceful as they protested the\noutcome of a case reminiscent of circumstances that spawned\nracially charged unrest in the nearby suburb of Ferguson and\ngave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014.\nPolice said several rocks and water bottles were thrown, and\nofficers were seen in video footage and by eyewitnesses dousing\nat least five people with pepper spray near the courthouse.\nBut the protests, while boisterous, were otherwise largely\npeaceful, and no serious injuries or acts of vandalism were\nreported.\nAs night fell, police reported making 13 arrests and said\nfour officers had been assaulted, though the confrontations were\ndescribed as fairly minor. One group of demonstrators tried to\nclimb onto Interstate 40 but was blocked by police officers in\nriot gear. Another group blocked an intersection by sitting down\nin the street for six minutes of silence.\nAfter most protesters drifted away late on Thursday,  a\nsmaller group of individuals police described as \"agitators\"\nlingered on the streets in a neighborhood near the mayor's home,\ntaunting officers who arrived in force.\nPolice fired volleys of tear gas as they ordered the crowd\nto disperse.\nThe outcry was prompted by Friday's verdict, rendered five\nweeks after the conclusion of a non-jury trial, finding former\ncity policeman Jason Stockley, 36, not guilty of first-degree\nmurder in the shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, 24.\nSmith was shot five times in his car after trying to flee\nStockley and his partner on Dec. 20, 2011, following an alleged\ndrug deal, authorities said.\nDuring the pursuit, Stockley could be heard saying on an\ninternal police car video he was going to kill Smith,\nprosecutors said.\nAt Stockley's direction, his partner, who was driving,\nslammed the police cruiser into Smith's vehicle and they came to\na stop, court documents said. Stockley then approached Smith's\ncar and opened fire with his service weapon.\nThe former policeman believed Smith was armed, defense\nattorneys said, and a gun was found in the car. But prosecutors\nargued Stockley planted the weapon and that the gun had only\nStockley's DNA on it.\nFollowing the verdict, some 600 protesters marched through\ndowntown St. Louis, chanting \"No justice, no peace\" and \"Hey\nhey! Ho ho! These killer cops have got to go!\" Some held signs\nthat read \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"No more racist killer cops.\"\nLater in the evening, several hundred protesters moved from\nthe courthouse to the city's popular restaurant neighborhood,\nthe Central West End, and the crowd began to grow again.\n\"I’m sad, I’m hurt, I’m mad,” the Reverend Clinton Stancil\nof the Wayman AME Church in St. Louis said by telephone. “We\nhaven’t made any progress since Ferguson, that’s clear. Cops can\nstill kill us with impunity.\"\nStockley's attorney, Neil Bruntrager, said his client was\nrelieved at the verdict. “It’s been a long road for him,”\nBruntrager said.\nIn his ruling, Judge Timothy Wilson said he doubted the\nprosecution's claim the gun was planted, writing: \"the court\nobserves, based on its nearly 30 years on the bench, that an\nurban heroin dealer not in possession of a firearm would be an\nanomaly.\"\nThe comment sparked outrage by protesters on the street and\non social media.\nMurder convictions against law enforcement officers are\nrare. In recent years grand juries have declined to even charge\nofficers involved in the 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown,\n18, which triggered waves of violent protests in Ferguson, and\nin the choking death of Eric Garner, 43, in New York. Both were\nunarmed and black.\nBrown's father, Michael Brown Sr., voiced his frustration\nafter Friday's verdict.\n\"You all know this ain't right and you all continue to do\nthis to us,\" he told a St. Louis television station. \"Like we\ndon't mean nothing, like we're rats, trash, dogs in the streets.\nRight now, I'm praying for my city because my people are tired\nof this.\"\nSt. Louis prosecutor Kimberly Gardner said she was\ndisappointed and called on protesters to avoid violence.\n“I understand the verdict has created anger and frustration\nfor many in our community,\" she told reporters at the\ncourthouse.\nStockley waived his right to a jury trial, allowing the\njudge to decide. He left the St. Louis Metropolitan Police\nDepartment in 2013 and was arrested last year.\nSmith's family settled a lawsuit against the city for\n$900,000 in 2013, according to Al Watkins, an attorney for\nSmith's fiancee, Christina Wilson.\n(Additional reporting by Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago; Chris\nKenning in Louisville, Kentucky; and Gina Cherelus in New York;\nWriting by Ben Klayman and Steve
