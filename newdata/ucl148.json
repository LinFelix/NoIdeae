Once out of the European Union, the country\nshould borrow to invest in infrastructure, reform the tax code\nand set immigration levels as it sees fit.\nA prominent Brexit campaigner in last year's referendum,\nJohnson also repeated the controversial claim that the\ngovernment would be 350 million pounds better off per week once\noutside the EU.\n\"My friends, I must report that there are at least some\npeople who are woefully underestimating this country,\" Johnson\nwrote in the Daily Telegraph. \"They think Brexit isn't going to\nhappen.\n\"I am here to tell you that this country will succeed in our\nnew national enterprise, and will succeed mightily.\n\"We have a glorious future.\"\n\nGRASSROOTS\nA favourite with grassroots members of the Conservative\nParty, Johnson had been expected to challenge for the leadership\nafter May gambled away her parliamentary majority in a June\nelection she did not need to call.\nInstead, he publicly pledged his loyalty. But the Times\nnewspaper reported earlier this week that Johnson believed he\nhad since been sidelined as May prepares to compromise over a\ndivorce bill with the EU to ease the negotiations.\n\"We would not expect to pay for access to their markets any\nmore than they would expect to pay for access to ours,\" he\nwrote. The article made no reference to a transition period the\ngovernment is expected to negotiate.\n\"And yes – once we have settled our accounts, we will take\nback control of roughly 350 million pounds per week,\" he said.\n\"It would be a fine thing, as many of us have pointed out, if a\nlot of that money went on the NHS (health service).\"\nOpposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the comments\nlaid bare the conflicts within May's government and cut the\nground from beneath the prime minister's authority.\nDuring the campaign, Johnson travelled around Britain on a\nbus emblazoned with a slogan suggesting that Britain was sending\n350 million pounds ($435 million) a week to the EU - a figure\nrejected as inaccurate by experts - and that the money would be\nbetter spent on the NHS.\nJohnson's Telegraph article was published shortly after the\nprime minister increased Britain's threat level to \"critical\"\nafter a bomb injured 29 people on a train on Friday morning.\n\"On the day of a terror attack where Britons were maimed,\njust hours after the threat level is raised, our only thoughts\nshould be on service,\" said Ruth Davidson, the popular leader of\nthe Conservatives in Scotland.\nWill Tanner, a former adviser to May, said the timing was\nastonishing, self-serving and disloyal. \"The real PM *just*\nraised threat level. Meanwhile guy who wants to replace her\nissues a prelude to resignation, to save face over 350 million\npounds. Hmm.\"\n(Editing by Andrew Bolton)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
