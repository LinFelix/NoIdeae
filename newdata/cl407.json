The Board wishes to\nreiterate that it rejects these allegations with the contempt\nthey deserve.\"\nThe PIC is seen as among the best-run of South Africa's\n300-odd state-owned companies and is the biggest investor in the\neconomy. It holds a large chunk of government bonds and huge\nstakes in blue-chip companies such as miner Anglo American\n, lender Barclays Africa and grocer\nretailer Shoprite.\nOn Thursday, South Africa's Treasury denied a report in\nanother newspaper that it was about to fire Matjila, although\nDeputy Finance Minister and PIC chair Sfiso Buthelezi confirmed\nthe board would seek \"clarification from him on internal\nmatters\" at Friday's meeting.\n($1 = 13.1319 rand)\n(Reporting by Tiisetso Motsoeneng; Writing by Joe Brock;\nEditing by Catherine Evans)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
