Kuwait University (KU) team discovered rare manuscripts written in Arabic at Mount Athos in Greece.\n\nThe archaeological mission, which included history Professors Dr Abdulhadi Al Ajmi and Dr Mohammad Al Marzouqi, visited monasteries and libraries in northern Greece.\n\nThey were able to unearth these documents at the historic mountain, which represented around 1,800 years of Christian history.\n\nDr Al Ajmi said that the discovery at Mount Athos, an ancient sacred place chosen as one of UNESCO's World Heritage sites in 1988, was crucial to understand the history of Arabs and Muslims in the region.\n\n\"Getting approval from the Greek authorities to study the site was not an easy task but we managed to do so and the reward was beyond great,\" he told KUNA.\n\nHe pointed out that the manuscripts, which date back to the golden Islamic age, cover various subjects pertaining to daily events, scientific observations, religious affairs and more.\n\nHe affirmed that the new discoveries will become an important reference point to those interested in what Arabs and Muslims had offered to Greece in the olden days.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
