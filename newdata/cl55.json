She's a profane 45-year-old woman struggling with alcohol and substance abuse, and she spent time in prison for murdering the Grinch, who was once her husband and fathered her daughter.\nDr. Seuss Enterprises accused Lombardo of exploiting the characters and themes of \"Grinch\" because he was too lazy to try \"working up something fresh.\"\nBut the judge said Lombardo turned the saccharine depictions of Who-Ville into an object of ridicule, where green beasts impregnate women, paparazzi \"run rabid,\" and citizens get high on \"Who Hash\" to avoid life's daily hassles.\n\"The play's coarseness and vulgarity lampoons 'Grinch' by highlighting the ridiculousness of the utopian society depicted in the original work: society is not good and sweet, but coarse, vulgar and disappointing,\" wrote Hellerstein, who was born in 1933 during the Great Depression.\n\"The play would not make sense without evoking the style and message of \"Grinch,' for which there would be no object of the parody,\" Hellerstein added. \"Whether the play's parody of 'Grinch' is effective, or in good taste, is irrelevant.\"\nThe case is Lombardo et al v Dr. Seuss Enterprises LP, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-09974.\n\n (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
