That's it.\" I find this idea so baldly stupid, offensive and infuriating, that I need to respond to it. Men have heard about the \"approach with confidence\" gambit for years. We're told about it as if it's some sort of foolproof method for achieving success in approaching women. For years, I approached women and tried to strike up a conversation. I never used tacky pick-up lines, and I've never been aggressive or appeared over eager. At school, I'd ask something friendly and neutral such as, \"so what are you writing your paper about?\" At work, I'd say, \"hi. You're new here right? How do you like the job so far?\" The reactions I got ranged from getting politely brushed off to not-so-politely getting brushed off. There was either a \"friendly\" or \"icy\" one word answer, or a dirty look. But they all made it abundantly clear that they wanted nothing to do with me. Did I not sound confident enough when saying \"hi?\" Maybe. I think the more likely answer is that they simply weren't interested or attracted to me at all, and there was nothing that I could say or do to change that. And I'm sure that my experiences are painfully familiar to many Vancouver men. Vancouver women know what they want in a partner, and it's much more than just confidence. Confidence is merely the icing on the cake. They want someone attractive, intelligent and financially successful. But the cold, hard truth is that many men have little to offer in this regard. Many of us are unattractive, mediocre and we struggle financially. There's no amount of confidence that will compensate for being \"a broke Danny Devito.\" The very idea is absurd. For generations, men with little to offer could still find a partner because we lived in a patriarchal society where women were dependent on men for economic reasons. Women can take care of themselves now and they are perfectly happy to remain single if they can't find a man who they're genuinely attracted to. The logical consequence of this is that many men will end up alone. There is no amount of confidence or \"swagger\" to display that will make up for the deficit between men seeking relationships and women who prefer being single. And for the record, I also need to say to the women reading this that all the times some loser clumsily flirted with you, couldn't take a hint and made you uncomfortable; he did it because someone told him that all he needed to do was act \"confident.\" I've never been on a date and I've never had a girlfriend. I've never fallen in love, been kissed or experienced any sort of intimacy. I accept it, and I've made my peace with it. I have no malice towards women though. I don't whine about feminists or women having impossible standards. I mean, I wouldn't want to date just anyone either. I do get lonely sometimes, but what bothers me most is listening to people repeat the lie that confidence makes a difference. I feel as if it's become a sadistic new pastime to mock men who are unsuccessful in dating. The accusation of insufficient confidence is used as a cudgel to denigrate men even further. It reminds me of rich people who scold poor people by saying, \"you people just aren't trying hard enough! You deserve to be miserable!\" I don't let my lack of success with women define who I am. I try to live with dignity and I suggest that my fellow travelers do the same. I just really wish that people would stop trolling men like me with the notion that confidence makes a whit of difference in meeting women. It doesn't.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
