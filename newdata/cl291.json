One has to take a breath and rise above\nit,\" Smith said at a news conference at the United Nations\nheadquarters.\n\"One has to do it every single day, from picking up a little\nbit of litter to turning off the faucet when you're brushing\nyour teeth.\"\nConsidered an icon of rock'n'roll and punk music, Smith, 70,\nis known for her album \"Horses\" and songs \"Gloria\" and \"Because\nthe Night.\" She has written several books including a memoir\n\"Just Kids\" and \"Devotion,\" released this week.\nThe \"Pathway to Paris\" concert on Nov. 5 comes on the eve of\na U.N. Convention on Climate Change being held in Bonn, Germany,\nwhere world leaders are meeting to advance the aims of the Paris\nagreement.\n\"To have these celebrations, a concert like this, where\nyou're able to reach a few thousand people that can speak to a\nfew thousand other people, it's a way to keep things moving from\nhand to hand and from voice to voice,\" Smith said.\nOthers slated to appear are musicians Flea, Cat Power and\nMichael Stipe. The concert is being organized by Pathway to\nParis, a group of artists and activists co-founded by Smith's\ndaughter, Jesse Paris Smith.\n\"It's everyone's fight,\" the younger Smith said at the news\nconference.\n\"When musicians or artists say 'I don't know the facts. I\ndon't know what to do,' I want to say, 'Excuse me, you've got a\nmicrophone, a stage, an audience and a following. You have a\nresponsibility to communicate these important messages to\npeople,'\" she said.\n(Reporting by Ellen Wulfhorst, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith;\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's\nrights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and\nresilience.
