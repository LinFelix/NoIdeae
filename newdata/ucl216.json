15 (Reuters) - The Cleveland Indians' 22-game winning streak came to an end on Friday when they were beaten 4-3 by the Kansas City Royals.\nOne night after securing the longest winning run in Major League Baseball (MLB) in more than a century, the Indians finally ran out of steam in front of a sellout home crowd in Cleveland.\nOnly the 1916 New York Giants (26) had a longer run of success though their remarkable stretch, which is recognized by the MLB as the longest in major league history, included a tie.\nDespite falling short of the all-time record, the streak vaulted the Indians to the best record in the American League, 91-57.\nWith less than three weeks until the playoffs, Cleveland is now set for another tilt at the World Series after losing the decisive seventh game in extra innings last year.\n(Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Peter Rutherford; )\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
