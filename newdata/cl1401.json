He was supposed to tour England with South Africa A in June but said then his rehabilitation had not gone as quickly as hoped.\n\nSouth African strike bowler Dale Steyn has delayed his return from a lengthy injury layoff\n\n'Right now I'm bowling fine but I haven't hit the full workload I'd need to handle in four-day cricket or a Test, so I decided it was best not to play', the 34-year-old told Cricinfo on Thursday.\n\nSteyn was planning to make his comeback for the Titans against the Dolphins on Tuesday.\n\nHis decision puts in jeopardy his chances of a comeback in the two-test series against Bangladesh, which starts in Potchefstroom on September 28.\n\nHe said he would rather play limited overs or club cricket to ease himself back into action.\n\nThe 34-year-old has been sidelined since fracturing his shoulder in November last year\n\n'I don't want to put myself or the team in a position where I pull up again,' he said.\n\n'Some shorter cricket might be the better answer for a reintroduction... I thought going from nothing to possibly bowling 30-plus overs was a bit of a risk.'\n\nSteyn, who is just five shy of surpassing Shaun Pollock as the country's leading Test wicket taker, also missed most of the 2015-16 test series against England because of shoulder problems.\n\nHe suffered the original injury in the Durban test against England at the end of 2015.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
