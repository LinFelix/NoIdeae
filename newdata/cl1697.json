The regulations limited what broadband providers can do with customer data.\n\nThe defeat capped a behind-the-scenes battle that pitted telecom companies against state internet service providers and brought other bills to a halt in the state Senate as negotiations unfolded over legislation that would have had national significance.\n\nMost of the so-called California Privacy Act would have codified the repealed restrictions crafted by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration.\n\nBut it also would have barred internet service companies from refusing to provide service or limiting service if customers do not waive their privacy rights. And it would have prohibited them from charging customers a penalty or offering customers discounts in exchange for waiving their privacy rights.\n\nThe bill had the support of former FCC chairman Tom Wheeler and smaller California internet service providers. Opponents -- which included tech giants like Google -- argued it was being rushed through the legislative process.\n\nFor internet service providers that are already complying with the former federal regulations, the bill would haven't made much of a difference operationally, said Ernesto Falcon, legislative counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group based in San Francisco. But the influence of the legislation could have been sweeping.\n\n\"California is a critical state because you are covering a large part of the nation just because of its population,\" he said. \"It sets the stage for other states to follow suit.\"\n\nFor now, efforts to implement the rules could move to the ballot box. A ballot initiative proposed this month would allow California consumers to know what personal information businesses are collecting, what they do with it and to whom they are selling it.\n\nLatest
