US District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto found he posed an \"ongoing danger or risk to the community\" by posting a $US5,000 bounty on Facebook for a strand of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's hair, an offer Shkreli later said was \"a joke.\"\n\nRelated Articles 'Own worst enemy': Pharma Bro's outspoken ways set to hurt him in sentencing Shkreli to be jailed for bounty on Hillary Clinton's hair\n\nFar from the tame image of white-collar prison camps, the MDC is a tough place, said Vincent McCrudden, a former hedge fund manager and commodities trader who spent eight months there in 2012 and 2015.\n\nLike Shkreli, McCrudden's comments helped land him in jail. McCrudden, 56, posted online rants threatening public officials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's very, very high security,\" McCrudden said. \"You're in there with murderers and cartel members.\"\n\nYou will now receive updates from Business AM Newsletter Business AM Newsletter\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nShkreli's usual wardrobe of jeans, T-shirts and hoodies has been replaced with what McCrudden called \"turd brown\" jumpsuits.\n\nShackles, strip searches, and holding cells with two to 20 inmates are all part of life at the MDC, McCrudden said in a phone interview. Bathroom facilities consist of toilets shared by inmates in two-man cells and a shower block.\n\nInmates generally have access to a handful of computers but strictly for emailing and research -- and no use of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Shkreli's other usual Internet hangouts. Phones are available but time is restricted, McCrudden said.\n\nInmates usually can move around during the day. But, they are on lockdown in their cells at night, he said. If an inmate is concerned for his safety, the only option is the Special Housing Unit, or SHU -- usually pronounced \"shoe.\" It's solitary confinement, used mostly for punishment, McCrudden said.\n\nCompared with the rest of the jail, the SHU was \"third-world disgusting,\" McCrudden said.\n\n\"The toilets don't work,\" he said. \"There are cockroaches, rats and mice.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons doesn't release information as to the conditions of an individual inmate's confinement for security reasons and doesn't discuss inmate behaviour due to privacy concerns, Justin Long, a bureau spokesman, said in an email..\n\nThe harsh image of Shkreli's imprisonment might be welcomed by his many critics. Shkreli became a focal point of national controversy when he raised the sticker price of a potentially life-saving drug by a whopping 5,000 per cent in 2015.\n\nHe outraged the public further by defending his decision, with his ubiquitous, smug smirk. At a Congressional hearing on drug-pricing in 2016, he refused to answer questions, citing his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and then called lawmakers \"imbeciles\" in a tweet.\n\nA frequent butt of online insults, Shkreli has been described in the press as the \"most hated man on the internet.\" Rather than shy away from negative attention, he has embraced it and prolonged his image as a villain on social media, with posts such as this one published just hours before he was sent off to prison:\n\nA friend of Shkreli's, Reida Powell, a medical assistant in Portland, Oregon, said she was \"shocked\" when she learned that his bail was revoked. Sending him to a high-security facility seemed \"extremely excessive for the situation.\"\n\nIn person, Shkreli is \"not threatening,\" Powell said. She said the Clinton comment was \"weird\" but \"we all say different things on the Internet that we wouldn't say in real life.\"\n\nPowell said she is worried about Shkreli's safety.\n\n\"He's not a popular person,\" she said. \"People threaten him on the Internet every day.\"\n\nDuring jury selection for Shkreli's trial in June, which was over securities fraud and conspiracy charges and had nothing to do with drug pricing, some potential jurors were excused after telling the judge they were already too biased against the former executive to serve. One juror said he looked like a \"snake.\" Another said he was the \"face of corporate greed.\"\n\nAlong with the offer for Clinton's hair, prosecutors cited Shkreli's online harassment of female journalists as further evidence he posed a threat. Shkreli was kicked off of Twitter earlier this year for \"targeted harassment\" of a journalist who publicly spurned his offer to be his date to Trump's inauguration.\n\nShkreli could face a risk of violence in the jail, which is a regular occurrence, according to McCrudden. But potentially the worst possibility -- prison rape -- is probably unlikely, he said.\n\n\"Martin may have trouble because it seems like he likes to talk a lot,\" McCrudden said.\n\n\"There's a thing in prison called 'stay in your lane.' You have to be highly tolerant of other people and be respectful and you'll be OK.\"\n\nBloomberg","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 19:54:44.764"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 19:54:43.673","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|\/m+1y+etUjWcYYAbbbaO7xWrLkg=|YtDb4Pvi7TgWag4KWB8QgAweazaB4\/I1PSheqRaPBrguSzKC0DdBiw==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/9efd0bee-0479-336f-a246-d987f6406804","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Business","importance":"1","originalValue":"Business"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/acd44d54-d8f3-3c36-a78c-2da2af5a2ae8","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Finance","importance":"1","originalValue":"Finance"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/6e33474c-6a7e-31cc-8626-9617df91433c","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Martin Shkreli","importance":"1","originalValue":"Martin Shkreli"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/f1af9688-5498-363e-9052-be898dce559c","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Money","importance":"2","originalValue":"Money"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/807c2140-9632-33b2-a3ea-8f73496df469","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Shkreli","importance":"2","originalValue":"Shkreli"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/4ed9a15d-0c90-33ac-9cbd-473ab4f4ca06","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"McCrudden","importance":"2","originalValue":"McCrudden"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/7":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/7","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/343b0587-8525-331f-8d3a-5f5e70cbfcd9","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Bail","importance":"2","originalValue":"Bail (Canada)"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/8":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/c61896be-884a-3aeb-aaf4-dbfd2d28e343\/SocialTag\/8","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/be13badf-d07b-3b0c-9277-22fdd83d29f1","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Kiyo A.
