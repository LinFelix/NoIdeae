The military denies any\npolicy of encouraging radical groups.\nBoth Islamist groups deny their political ambitions were\nengineered by the military. The official army spokesman was not\navailable for comment after queries were sent to the press wing.\nStill, hundreds of MML supporters, waving posters of Saeed\nand demanding his release from house arrest, chanted \"Long live\nHafiz Saeed! Long live the Pakistan army!\" at political rallies\nduring the past week.\n\"Anyone who is India's friend is a traitor, a traitor,\" went\nanother campaign slogan, a reference to Sharif's attempts to\nimprove relations with long-time foe India that was a source of\ntension with the military.\n\n'DERADICALISATION' PLAN\nBoth Saeed and Khalil are proponents of a strict\ninterpretation of Islam and have a history of supporting\nviolence - each man was reportedly a signatory to al Qaeda\nleader Osama bin Laden's 1998 fatwa declaring war on the United\nStates.\nThey have since established religious groups that they say\nare unconnected to violence, though the United States maintains\nthose groups are fronts for funnelling money and fighters to\nmilitants targeting India.\nAnalyst Khaled Ahmed, who has researched Saeed's\nJamaat-ud-Dawa charity and its connections to the military, says\nthe new political party is clearly an attempt by the generals to\npursue an alternative to dismantling its militant proxies.\n\"One thing is the army wants these guys to survive,\" Ahmed\nsaid. \"The other thing is that they want to also balance the\npoliticians who are more and more inclined to normalise\nrelations with India.\"\nThe military's Inter-Services Intelligence agency first\nbegan pushing the political mainstreaming plan in April 2016,\naccording to retired general Shuaib, a former director of the\narmy's military intelligence wing that is separate from the ISI.\nHe said the proposal was shared with him in writing by the\nthen-ISI chief, adding that he himself had spoken with Khalil as\nwell as Saeed in an unofficial capacity about the plan.\n\"Fazlur Rehman Khalil was very positive. Hafiz Saeed was\nvery positive,\" Shuaib said. \"My conversation with them was just\nto confirm those things which I had been told by the ISI and\nother people.\"\nSaeed has been under house arrest since January at his\nhouse in the eastern city of Lahore. The United States has\noffered a $10 million reward for information leading to his\nconviction over the Mumbai attacks.\nThen-Prime Minister Sharif, however, was strongly against\nthe military's mainstreaming plan, according to Shuaib and three\nmembers of Sharif's inner circle, including one who was in some\nof the tense meetings over the issue.\nSharif wanted to completely dismantle groups like JuD.\nDisagreement on what to do about anti-India proxy fighters was a\nmajor source of rancour with the military, according to one of\nthe close Sharif confidants.\nIn recent weeks several senior figures from the ruling PML-N\nparty have publicly implied that elements of the military -\nwhich has run Pakistan for almost half its modern history and\npreviously ousted Sharif in a 1999 coup - had a hand in the\ncourt ouster of Sharif, a charge both the army and the court\nreject.\nA representative of the PML-N, which last month replaced\nhim as prime minister with close ally Shahid Khaqi Abbasi, said\nthe party was \"not aware\" of any mainstreaming plan being\nbrought to the table.\n\nRELIGION AND POLITICS\nSome analysts worry that mainstreaming such controversial\ngroups would be a risky strategy for Pakistan.\nU.S. President Donald Trump's administration has threatened\nsanctions against members of Pakistan's military and even raised\nthe spectre of declaring Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\"It will send a wrong message,\" said analyst Zahid Hussain,\nwho nevertheless thought that Saeed's new party would have a\n\"negligible\" effect on Pakistani elections because religious\nparties have never won more than a few seats in parliament.\nOthers are not so sure.\nSheikh, the MML candidate in Sunday's by-election who says\nhe was handpicked by Hafiz Saeed, vowed to establish strict\nIslamic rule and \"break\" liberalism and secularism.\nAnalyst Ahmed warned that few existing religious parties\nhave a charismatic leader like Saeed, and Pakistan may find\nitself unable to control a rising tide of Islamist sentiment.\n\"If Hafiz Saeed comes into the mainstream, it's not that he\nis going to be politicised,\" he added. \"It's that he is going to\nmake politics more religious.\"\n(Additional reporting by Mubasher Bukhari in LAHORE, Syed Raza\nHassan in KARACHI; Writing by Kay Johnson; Editing by
