Alden Smith, and owned by the Board of Education since the 1970s.\n\nInterest in, and money for, the Bowman has ebbed and flowed over many budget cycles; it is now at a very low point. In fact, several educators I spoke with were not even sure it was still owned by the school board. But it is, and there are no dollars specifically earmarked for the Bowman in the current school year budget, according to Kim Eves, GPS communications director.\n\nThe state-of-the-art, folded optical design telescope sits idle all but two nights a month, its telltale dome closed tight against the elements. On those two open evenings, the Bowman is manned by volunteers from the Astrological Society of Greenwich, one of whom is usually Rick Bria, a citizen scientist who is the group's vice president and chief astronomer.\n\nBria came to astronomy while a student in the early 1970s at Western Middle School; it is a passion that has taken him to many places around the globe in pursuit of new vantage points from which to study the stars. He also manages a private telescope on Round Hill Road and the observatory at Sacred Heart School on King Street.\n\nBy the early 2000s the Bowman Observatory had fallen into serious disrepair and was almost unusable. Then, in 2007, the town ponied up for a new, motorized, revolving dome to replace the original, fixed dome.\n\n\"One of our donors saw the new dome being installed and called to see if we wanted a new telescope,\" Bria said. By 2010, according to Bria, several generous donors had raised about $30,000 allowing the astrological society to donate a RCOS Carbon Truss 16\" Ritchey-Chretien f\/8.4 telescope. Those in the know about astronomical instruments say that is one cool telescope.\n\nOne might think donating a $30,000 telescope to the school board would have been an easy task. But it was not. The town took about four years to accept the generous gift; officials were concerned that it would carry high annual maintenance and operating expenses. So as the budget battle continued with no end in sight, the telescope sat idle in its crate in one of the donor's homes.\n\n\"He eventually called us and asked us to take it out of his house,\" Bria said. The Havemeyer Building became its next repository, where Bria went looking for it after the school board accepted the gift in 2014.\n\n\"It was like that scene in the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' when they were searching among all those boxes,\" Bria said, laughing at the memory. \"We couldn't find it at first among everything down in the Havemeyer Building's basement. But we found it eventually. And then a few days later someone called and they had found a box of parts.\"\n\nThe town built a new concrete base to exacting specifications so the telescope's guidance system could function properly. \"It is computer-controlled and very sophisticated. It knows its exact location on Earth and it we can direct it via computer to the exact object we want to see. There is no more guess work,\" Bria said.\n\n\"It is a fantastic telescope and one that any university would be proud to own. We are very lucky to have it in Greenwich,\" said the astronomer.\n\nScience, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) is a significant educational focus these days. And Greenwich has this valuable, somewhat unique resource that is not integrated into the GPS curriculum. No one seems quite sure why that is, and it is easy to understand how a relatively small building gets lost amid the debates about big new schools, racial imbalance and school start times. But this gem is hidden in plain sight, and it would be great to make it available to every student, or interested adult for that matter, in town.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
