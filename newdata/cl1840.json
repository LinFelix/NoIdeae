The event was hosted by the Cañon City Public Library and the Cañon City Public Library Foundation.\n\nHasan Davis has committed a great deal of his time and talent sharing the stories of some of America's heroes who either have been left out of history books or have long been forgotten.\n\nThrough his living history performances, Davis brings to life York, the body servant of William Clark; A.A. Burleigh, a Civil War veteran who escaped slavery; and Joe Louis, a boxer and heavyweight champion known as the \"Brown Bomber,\" sharing their struggles and triumphs.\n\nBut Davis has overcome his own obstacles in life.\n\nIt was the constant encouragement from his mother, and a chance meeting with Dr. Maya Angelou several years ago that spurred him to finish school and continue to work toward writing the ending to his own story.\n\nDavis' early years were troubled. He first was arrested at age 11 and later expelled from an alternative high school.\n\n\"Most of my childhood could be summed up as challenging -- growing up with a learning disability, locked in the coat room in first grade, those types of things,\" he said. \"We dealt with poverty, home insecurity, all of those things that families deal with when they have challenges, but we always had a really core foundation at home.\"\n\nDavis and his sister were encouraged to explore their artistic sides, and the entire family entertained one another with talent shows.\n\n\"My younger sister didn't even know we were poor until she got to college and learned about indicators of poverty in her business class, and then it all came together for her,\" he said. \"She thought we were all just having fun, doing plays with candles on, she didn't know the power was out.\"\n\nBecause he was exposed to the arts at an early age, writing became an important part of Davis' success in dealing with other challenges.\n\n\"An extension of that was theater,\" he said. \"I had disabilities that forced me to have to engage people pretty quickly at a deep level in order to be able to glean as much as I could from them to be able to process and move through school without being able to read like other kids.\"\n\nAfter earning his GED, Davis attended Berea College where he met Dr. Maya Angelou in the spring of 1988.\n\n\"She kept telling me, 'You have a story to tell,' and she said, 'You need to finish this story,'\" Davis said. \"It was one of those moments when I had been fighting to stay in school, I had been dealing with drama and trauma, and she said, 'Your story is not done; you need to finish your story.' It inspired me to stay connected and focused.\"\n\nDavis went on to make the Dean's List, he was elected student body president and homecoming king, and he was the lead in school plays.\n\n\"Things really did start to connect,\" he said.\n\nTheater was a significant part of Davis' college years, until another student challenged that he couldn't do \"real work,\" like become a lawyer. That's when Davis decided to go to law school, just to prove that he could do it.\n\n\"I worked with these kids every summer, and I told them that nobody could stop them, and we talked about falling down and getting up,\" Davis said. \"I said 'I can't be a liar, so now I have to go to law school.'\"\n\nDespite having been expelled from law school three times and continuing to struggle with his learning disability, Davis stayed in class and later graduated. A large part of his work the last 20 years was with youth issues and pushing juvenile justice reform.\n\nDuring the last six years of his law career, Davis provided executive leadership to the Kentucky Department of Juvenile Justice, serving as Deputy Commissioner for Facilities and Operations and then as Commissioner.\n\nDavis now is spending more time getting back into living history performances in Kentucky and across the nation.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
