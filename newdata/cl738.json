Gerry Connolly this week told Politico that the party's rank-and-file base wants to at least know periodically that \"parameters are being set.\"\n\n'Let's not fool ourselves,\" Connolly also said. Trump \"is this person we know, and I just think there must be both political and moral limitations with how far we're willing to cooperate with that.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans are also concerned, considering they control and House and Senate, with fellow party member Trump in the White House.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and other GOP House members adamantly insisted that there was no agreement this week to enshrine protections for the immigrants brought to America as children and now here illegally.\n\nJohn Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, put it this way: There was \"a deal to make a deal.\"\n\nTrump said he was \"fairly close\" to an agreement that could protect Dreamers while adding border security, as long as his long-promised wall with Mexico was also separately addressed.\n\nPelosi and Schumer have insisted there was discussion and even agreement on legislation that would offer eventual citizenship to the immigrants in question.\n\nTrump recently gave Congress six months to come up with a solution before the Dreamers' protections would end, though what he would actually do absent congressional action is uncertain.\n\nTrump has appeared to enjoy his newfound luster as a bipartisan dealmaker since the disaster-and-debt deal he struck with Pelosi and Schumer last week stunned Washington and garnered a stack of positive headlines.\n\nTrump has referred to Schumer and Pelosi as \"Chuck and Nancy\" and struck the deals after Senate Republicans failed to pass a measure to repeal and replace ObamaCare, leaving a major Trump campaign promise unfulfilled.\n\nSchumer, too, clearly relishes the deal making; he was caught on a live microphone on the Senate floor Thursday gleefully telling Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.: \"He likes us! He likes me, anyway.\"\n\nThe willingness to engage with a president reviled by their party also worries liberals like Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., who warned against \"proceeding toward normalizing him.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
