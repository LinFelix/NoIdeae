McMaster took a\ntough line on North Korea, warning that a military option to\ndeal with its nuclear threats was available.\nTrump will meet with leaders from Europe, Asia, the Middle\nEast and Latin America throughout the week, but his remarks,\nscheduled for Tuesday morning, will be the president's highest\nprofile opportunity to explain his foreign policy vision couched\nin his \"America first\" agenda.\n\"I personally think he slaps the right people, he hugs the\nright people, and he comes out with (the) U.S. being very\nstrong, in the end,\" Haley, speaking at the White House, said of\nTrump's speech.\nHaley declined to say whether Trump would commit Washington\nto maintaining its current level of funding for the 193-nation\nbody. Trump has complained that the United States funds 22\npercent of the U.N. budget and nearly 30 percent of U.N.\npeacekeeping duties.\nTrump will kick off the week with a meeting about U.N.\nreform on Monday. He will then have meetings with French\nPresident Emmanuel Macron and Israeli Prime Minister Prime\nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu that will focus on Iran, McMaster\nsaid. Trump has dinner scheduled with Latin American leaders.\nOn Tuesday, he will meet Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin\nHamad al-Thani. Trump said last week he would be willing to\nmediate the worst dispute in decades between Qatar and\nU.S.-allied Arab states.\nOn Wednesday, he will meet with leaders from Jordan, the\nPalestinian Authority, Britain and Egypt and on Thursday there\nare talks scheduled with leaders from Turkey, Afghanistan and\nUkraine before holding a lunch with the leaders of South Korea\nand Japan.\nMcMaster said it was unlikely that Trump would speak to\nVenezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, whom the White House has\nsanctioned and called a dictator.\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason and Roberta Rampton; editing
