LOUIS, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Eight police officers were\ninjured in clashes with demonstrators in St Louis when a largely\npeaceful protest turned violent in the early hours of Saturday\nafter a Missouri judge acquitted a former white police officer\nof murder in the 2011 fatal shooting of a black man suspected of\ndealing drugs.\nThe clashes erupted when police confronted a small group of\ndemonstrators as the protest moved, over the course of the\nevening, from the courthouse where the verdict was read to a\nbusy nightlife neighborhood.\nAfter most protesters drifted away, a smaller group of\nindividuals police described as \"agitators\" lingered on the\nstreets in an upscale neighborhood near the mayor's home,\ntaunting officers who arrived in riot gear by the busload.\nPolice used tear gas and rubber bullets to control the crowd\nas vandals broke windows at a library, a restaurant and a home\nand threw bricks and water bottles at officers.\nPolice reported making at least 13 arrests. Three officers\nwere taken to hospital.\n\"Reports of bricks thrown at police. That's not protest.\nThat's a crime. We stand behind our officers. This violence\nwon't be tolerated,\" Missouri Governor Eric Greitens said on\nTwitter.\nWith National Guard troops placed on standby, authorities\nurged calm in the aftermath of a case reminiscent of the\ncircumstances that spawned racially charged unrest in the nearby\nsuburb of Ferguson, giving rise to the Black Lives Matter\nmovement in 2014.\nOne group of demonstrators tried to climb onto Interstate 40\nbut were blocked by police. Another group blocked an\nintersection by sitting down in the street for six minutes of\nsilence.\nThe outcry was prompted by Friday's verdict, rendered five\nweeks after the conclusion of a non-jury trial, finding former\ncity policeman Jason Stockley, 36, not guilty of first-degree\nmurder in the shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, 24.\nSmith was shot five times in his car after trying to flee\nStockley and his partner on Dec. 20, 2011, following an alleged\ndrug deal, authorities said.\nDuring the pursuit, Stockley could be heard saying on an\ninternal police car video he was going to kill Smith,\nprosecutors said.\nAt Stockley's direction, his partner, who was driving,\nslammed the police cruiser into Smith's vehicle and they came to\na stop, court documents said. Stockley then approached Smith's\ncar and opened fire with his service weapon.\nThe former policeman believed Smith was armed, defense\nattorneys said, and a gun was found in the car. But prosecutors\nargued Stockley planted the weapon and that the gun had only\nStockley's DNA on it.\n(Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee, Suzannah\nGonzales in Chicago, Chris
