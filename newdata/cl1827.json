It's more than timely, it's more than right, for the history of Māori people to be included as part of the curriculum taught in all our schools.\"\n\nThe New Zealand Educational Institute, the New Zealand Post Primary Teachers' Association and the New Zealand School Trustees' Association were among the organisations that had helped to bring the change about, he said.\n\nIt has taken two years or work to arrive at this stage, Mr Bird said.\n\n\"This is a triumph for the teaching profession who will be teaching Māori history.\"\n\nDespite there being people who didn't want to recognise Māori history, Mr Bird said his focus was on the future.\n\n\"We've got other generations coming through so there's a sense of optimism and positivity.\"\n\nFormer Prime Ministers Jim Bolger and Sir Geoffrey Palmer have also thrown their support behind the teaching of colonial history to young people.\n\nTe Takanga o Te Wa is expected to rollout in schools early next year.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
