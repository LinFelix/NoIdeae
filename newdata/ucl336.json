They fear increased tensions between Baghdad and\nErbil will distract from the war on Islamic State militants who\nstill occupy parts of Iraq and Syria.\n\"We still haven't heard a proposal that can be an\nalternative to the Kurdistan referendum,\" Barzani told a rally\nin the Kurdish region, referring to a proposal put forward by\nthe U.S. and other Western envoys this week.\nIraq's neighbours Iran and Turkey also oppose the\nplebiscite, fearing an independent Kurdish state could fuel\nseparatism among their own Kurdish populations.\nThe opposition Gorran movement boycotted Friday's\nparliamentary session, the first since a dispute between them\nand Barzani's KDP caused the suspension of the assembly in\nOctober 2015.\n\"Those assembled in parliament today think this is a lawful\nsession, but this is unlawful,\" Birzu Majeed, the head of\nGorran's parliamentary block, told a news conference held while\nparliament was in session.\nLawmakers from a third party, the Patriotic Union of\nKurdistan (PUK), ensured the required quorum. The PUK is a\nhistoric rival of the KDP but supports the referendum plan.\nMeanwhile, Iranian-backed Iraqi Shi'ite paramilitary groups\nhave threatened to dislodge the Kurdish forces from the Kirkuk\nregion, which is due to take part in the referendum.\nKirkuk is home to sizeable Arab and Turkmen populations and\nlies outside the official boundaries of the Kurdistan region. It\nis claimed by both the Kurds and the central government in\nBaghad.\nKurdish peshmerga fighters seized Kirkuk and other disputed\nterritories when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic\nState in 2014, preventing its oilfields from falling into\nmilitant hands.\n(Reporting by Raya Jalabi; Editing by Maher Chmaytelli and\nGareth Jones)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
