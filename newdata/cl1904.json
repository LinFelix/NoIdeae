Any slight delay or a short-of-best response, and the customer may look elsewhere to solve the problem. Even switch over to a competitor. As businesses push to reduce inefficiencies and costs, automation and other artificial intelligence (AI) programs are gaining prominence. And contact centers of the future may look beyond human agents to handle simple customer queries to provide better resolutions.\n\nWill chatbots be the answer to provide better customer care in the future? Which human tasks can chatbots perform diligently, and can they perform complex tasks hitherto managed by humans? The jury is out on that. But the bigger question is, do we see a model of coexistence emerge in the future where the agent and the bot complement each other's value proposition? In my assessment, this situation would be both scary and bright. Scary because it will demand an overhaul of the workplace. Bright as it will create a new niche agent work model.\n\nThe Case for Chatbots\n\nWhen chatbots were first introduced around 1966, they were programmed to respond to a user's questions with simple matching patterns. Today, they possess sophisticated techniques to understand users' questions and deliver useful and relevant responses. For a chatbot, time is never a constraint. If a customer calls even at midnight for an issue resolution, the chatbot is at his service. If the customer is dissatisfied with the resolution and wants a longer conversation, the bot can still handle it.\n\nWith businesses looking at reducing hiring and recruitment costs, chatbots can provide significant cost savings by replacing live agents at lower costs. For businesses, good customer service equals brand success. By using chatbots for instant response - even if it is just a plain \"thank you\" - and providing appropriate timelines for resolution, businesses earn customer goodwill. Chatbots may be contact centers' answer to the fundamental question: How do you delight customers without losing the human touch?\n\nChatbots assist businesses by providing real-time, accurate responses to low-complexity customer queries, which largely revolve around non-functional product, warranty expiration, etc. Since time is of the essence, chatbots can bypass dependency on repair personnel and directly provide responses to customers and save precious time. Also, customer information is stored in the organizational database, making it easier for chatbots to dig out previous instances of customer problems and offer speedy resolution.\n\nThe Numbers Prove It\n\nSo how good are bots really? Studies have been conducted to gauge the efficiency and the future of chatbots. The number of users of virtual assistants in the US will grow by 23.1% in 2017. And by 2022, chatbots will save over $8 billion annually, up from $20 million in 2017. Let's look at the consumer side. About 27% of customers were unsure whether their last service interaction was with a bot or a human. And 40% didn't care who answered their query -- an agent or a bot - as long as it was resolved.\n\nSo, bots are slowly blurring the lines between a human and a software program. The perception about bots is changing among customers, although favoring bots completely over human interactions is still a long way. Attitude-wise, 38% of consumers worldwide rated their overall perception of bots as positive, while only 11% rated their interaction as negative. When it comes to bots with \"personality,\" 48% customers worldwide prefer a bot that solves their issues rather than a bot with a personality.\n\nWith businesses including chatbots in increased frequency in customer interactions, the perception ratings of the bots will rise rapidly. The numbers are the best indication to prove it. And the interesting thing is its application across different industries. There is increased acceptance of chatbots, especially among customers, to resolve their queries. In an era of acute competition for business share, we will see their numbers only move up in the future.\n\nThe Trouble With Bots\n\nIn 2016, Microsoft released an AI bot named Tay, designed to mimic language patterns of a 19-year-old American girl and learn from interacting with Twitter users. But Tay began tweeting inflammatory and racist messages. An alarmed Microsoft shut down the bot only 16 hours after launch. Similarly, Facebook's bot created panic in the tech world when reports emerged it had created its own unique language. But the issue was blown out of proportion, and Facebook slammed the alarmist headlines.\n\nThe underlying fact is the world is wary of chatbots\/AI. Every technology has its limitation, and bots are no different. When customers interact with a bot, there may be occasions where the conversations might turn personal. A smart agent will notice this and try to steer the conversation to its original purpose. Since a bot is programmed to respond to any type of interaction, it might not be able to control unwanted conversations.\n\nA human agent can easily differentiate between a happy, sad, or angry customer and shape his responses accordingly. But can a bot in a contact center understand the vagaries of human emotions? We are in an era where agents are expected to provide personalized service to customers. In a crisis call, the bot may fail to recognize that a customer is in distress and its response may turn out to be lopsided. It may not be the bot's fault, but the customer will fault the contact center itself!\n\nThe Future of Chatbots\n\nA study says nearly 80% of companies have used or plan to use chatbots by 2020. As AI marches, chatbots will move beyond customer service roles. But on the larger question whether they can fully replace human agents, the answer is no! They can be enhancements to the existing customer service processes. They can be deployed for basic, routine, and mundane tasks, freeing agents for complex processes. In the customer service business, chatbots will result in reduced holding times, improved FCR, and higher CSAT.\n\nMarketing, sales, research, lead generation are some areas where chatbots can be deployed. Contact centers that handle healthcare clients can use chatbots to expedite consultation-related paperwork and save time on administrative tasks. In finance, streamlining of cumbersome processes can be relegated to chatbots. Chatbots in retail and e-commerce businesses can be used to provide personalized shopping experience to customers and assist them in making logical decisions during shopping.\n\nWe do see a future where businesses will integrate chatbots in many operations. Their use will help contact centers to reduce operational costs and improve process efficiencies - the two mantras the BPM industry lives by. Chatbots will not replace intelligent human operations, but they will surely complement and assist human agents in delivering superior customer service. The art of crystal-gazing is fraught with risks, but chatbots are here to stay!\n\n(Ratna Puri is Associate Director, Training and Quality, Concentrix India.)","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
