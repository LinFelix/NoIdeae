The EPA said\nearlier this week it was responding to more than a dozen spills\nin the wake of Harvey, but said it could not immediately provide\nvolume estimates.\nThe U.S. Coast Guard reports showed over 22,000 barrels of\ncrude oil, gasoline, diesel, drilling wastewater, and\npetrochemicals spilled from refineries, storage terminals and\nother facilities in the days after the storm.\nNearly half of those came from a 10,988-barrel spill of\nunleaded gasoline from Magellan Midstream Partners' storage\nfacility in Galena Park, Texas, according to the\nreports, confirmed by a company official.\n\"We expect clean-up operations to be completed within a few\nweeks,\" the company said in an email on Thursday. Most of the\ngasoline had been removed, it said, including quantities that\nspilled offsite and into the Houston Ship Channel, and remaining\nwork was mainly focused on removing contaminated soil.\nThe Coast Guard filings also showed some 365 tons of toxic\nchemicals like sulfur dioxide, ammonia, toluene, benzene, and\ncarbon monoxide escaped from facilities during the storm.\nIn addition, some 27 million cubic feet (765,000 cubic\nmeters) of natural gas, 1,000 tons of asphalt, and unknown\nquantities of other substances from more than 200 other\nincidents also escaped, according to the data.\nOfficials for the Coast Guard and the EPA did not\nimmediately respond to requests for comment on the filings.\nAs some spill estimates were preliminary, it was too early\nto assess pollution damage from the storm, said Tom Pelton, a\nspokesman for environmental advocacy group the Environmental\nIntegrity Project.\nOne company is already raising its spill estimates: Valero\nEnergy Corp told the EPA it probably underestimated the\nemissions of dangerous chemicals when the roof of a storage tank\nat its Houston refinery collapsed in the storm.\nValero defended its handling of the spill, noting its\ninitial calculation came during the storm and crews kept the\nspill within its grounds. \"We have been diligent in responsibly\naddressing the tank release and taking steps to minimize any\npotential impacts,\" it said. Air monitoring systems that showed\nelevated benzene and other emissions likely included sources\nother than its own plant, it added.\nKatrina caused 190,000 barrels of oil spills along the\nLouisiana coastline, according to Donald Davis, the\nadministrator of the Louisiana Applied Oil Spill Research and\nDevelopment Program, who presented his findings to the EPA in\n2006.\n(Reporting by Emily
