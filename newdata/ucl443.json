World Food Programme (WFP), according to U.N. agencies.\nAid agencies hope that these cash transfers mean families\nwill not be forced to take their children out of school or sell\ntheir assets in order to ensure they have enough food to eat.\nThe WFP said it is distributing rations of rice, beans,\nvegetable oil and salt to the affected households.\n\"Families have suffered, lives have been lost and property\ndestroyed through these unprecedented disasters,\" said Hamid El\nBashir Ibrahim, UNICEF's representative in Sierra Leone.\n\"The cash transfers could be a great relief ... as they will\nprovide a lifeline,\" Ibrahim said in a statement.\nThe country of 6 million people is one of the poorest in the\nworld and was ravaged by West Africa's 2014-16 Ebola outbreak,\nwhich killed about 4,000 people in the former British colony.\n(1 British pound = $1.3565)\n(Reporting By Kieran Guilbert, Editing by Ros Russell; Please\ncredit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm
