We work as a partner and help build capacity, bring technology, build a procurement system and constantly check all the progress. For example, in Mizoram there are 10 JICA experts who have developed a manual for agriculture and we will also support in making a master plan. We have put together a training manual for the government officials there. We are happy to be a catalyst for interdepartmental cooperation. We have a vehicle that invites Indian officials to join the JICA training programme in Japan.\n\nOn JICA vs other western bilateral aid bodies\n\nSince the 1950s, while many European countries have provided aid and support to many sub-Saharan countries, they were focused on charity-led support based on Christianity. They looked at social support with initiatives like vaccines and setting up primary schools. Our model has been different. JICA supported Asian countries where we looked at building on synergies and development through trade, investment and cooperation. (Today, you can see the difference in the two models with different levels of impact.) We have a history of supporting and we have learnt lessons while helping other countries. We want to do that in India.\n\nOn JICA's evolution and the India thrust\n\nI came here in 2015. I was in Beijing in the 1990s when China's GDP was much smaller. Its developmental needs were gigantic then and we did many things to support them. Roughly, till 2000, China was our biggest operations. I worked in the Middle East, Africa and Japan before coming to India. Since 2008, India has been our largest operation. A quarter of people below the global poverty line live in India. Of a billion people defecating in the open, 60% are in India. India has huge development needs. Besides fund, our bigger role is in (creating a) mindset change and capacity-building. We have given funds for construction of over 1,500 public toilets. But for that to be successful requires a mindset change so that people start using them.\n\nWe are a frank friend of India. When we began working on Delhi Metro, there was no concept of timing or punctuality. For Indian Railways then, half a day delay was normal. There was no trust in service delivery. Sensitivity towards the disabled and women passengers too was not there. So we focused on knowledge-sharing. Delhi Metro staff worked as quasi JICA staff to ensure standards. Today, Delhi Metro is clean, comfortable and punctual. Its ridership at 3 million is higher than that of Osaka.\n\nOn the ambitious bullet train project\n\nWe are now working on a high-speed train, which will be completed by 2023. (Post the interview, the deadline has been advanced to 2022). It is a challenging project. Like Shinkansen, we are looking at sustainable development with a focus on safety and reliability of service.\n\nOn warm bilateral ties\n\nIndia has supported us in difficult times. Now it is our time to help. Since 2015, the relationship has become much closer. We share views on democracy and market economy. Since 2005, we have been having an annual summit between the two nations. We now want to upgrade the relationship -- from an older to a newer one. JICA will help create a better business environment in India.\n\nOn JICA's plans in India\n\nWe want to provide stable support. We will support in areas of social sector, environment and agriculture and in initiatives like Swachh Bharat and open defecation. The Northeast is an important area where we will be working closely. Aligned with Modi's policy, we want the region to have enhanced connectivity with the rest of India and its neighbours.\n\nOn JICA's challenges in India\n\nLand acquisition is a big challenge. We take environmental and social factors into consideration and prepare an impact assessment report to avoid any future setback. We need more streamlined government procedures for environmental clearances and land acquisition. We also need timely allocation of local budget. In most cases, we are not the project owners. Typically, JICA lends 85% of the cost while 15% comes from the local body.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
