They last won a grand prix at the end of 2012.\nBrown was confident the gap could be bridged and said the team -- largely owned by Bahrain's Mumtalakat Holding Company and Saudi-born businessman Mansour Ojjeh -- was prepared to bear the short-term financial pain.\n\"We’re fortunate in that we have very committed shareholders, that the remit is to go win races, make the right sporting decisions and then the business will follow,\" said the American.\n\"It’ll take some time but our shareholders are very committed, very aware and we wouldn’t have made this decision if we weren’t prepared to work through short-term economic loss from the lack of Honda income.\" (Reporting by Abhishek Takle, editing by Alan Baldwin and Toby Davis)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
