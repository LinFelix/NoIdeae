LOUIS, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Police using tear gas and\nrubber bullets clashed with demonstrators in St Louis in the\nearly hours of Saturday after a white former policeman was\nacquitted of murdering a black suspect.\nA peaceful protest over Friday's not guilty verdict turned\nviolent after police confronted a small group of demonstrators -\nthree years after the police shooting of another black suspect\nin the nearby suburb of Ferguson stirred nationwide anger and\ndebate.\nOfficers fired tear gas as people broke windows at a\nlibrary, a restaurant and a home and threw bricks and water\nbottles at officers. Eight officers were injured, police said.\nFormer city policeman Jason Stockley, 36, was found not\nguilty of the first-degree murder of Anthony Lamar Smith, 24,\nshot to death on Dec. 20, 2011.\nAfter the ruling, around 600 protesters marched from the\ncourthouse through downtown St. Louis, chanting \"No justice, no\npeace\" and \"Hey hey! Ho ho! These killer cops have got to go!\"\nSome held \"Black Lives Matter\" signs.\n\"I’m sad, I’m hurt, I’m mad,” the Reverend Clinton Stancil\nof the Wayman AME Church in St. Louis said by telephone. “We\nhaven’t made any progress since Ferguson, that’s clear. Cops can\nstill kill us with impunity.\"\n\n\"NO PROGRESS SINCE FERGUSON\"\nFerguson became the focal point of a national debate on race\nrelations after white officer Darren Wilson shot dead black\nteenager Michael Brown on Aug. 9, 2014. Protests and clashes\nbroke out after a grand jury cleared the officer, giving rise to\nthe Black Lives Matter movement.\nAfter Friday's verdict, one group of demonstrators tried to\nclimb onto Interstate 40 but was blocked by police. Another\ngroup blocked an intersection by sitting down in the street for\nsix minutes of silence.\nAfter most protesters drifted away, a smaller group of\npeople police described as \"agitators\" lingered on the streets\ntaunting officers who arrived in riot gear by the busload.\n\"Reports of bricks thrown at police. That's not protest.\nThat's a crime. We stand behind our officers. This violence\nwon't be tolerated,\" Missouri Governor Eric Greitens said on\nTwitter.\nSmith was shot five times in his car after trying to flee\nStockley and his partner, following an alleged drug deal,\nauthorities said.\nProsecutors said that during the pursuit, Stockley could be\nheard saying on an internal police car video he was going to\nkill Smith.\nAt Stockley's direction, his partner, who was driving,\nslammed the police cruiser into Smith's vehicle and they came to\na stop. Stockley then approached Smith's car and opened fire\nwith his service weapon, court documents said.\nThe former policeman believed Smith was armed, defense\nattorneys said, and a gun was found in the car. But prosecutors\nargued Stockley planted the weapon and that the gun had only\nStockley's DNA on it.\nStockley's attorney, Neil Bruntrager, said his client was\nrelieved at the verdict. “It’s been a long road for him,”\nBruntrager said.\n(Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee, Suzannah\nGonzales in Chicago, Chris Kenning in Louisville, Kentucky and\nGina Cherelus in New York;
