But ... we should wait for\nthe final conclusions of this investigation.\"\nNyamitwe is expected to respond to the allegations at the\nU.N. Human Rights Council next week. Burundi has rejected the\nfindings of the U.N. inquiry, which Nyamitwe said was a puppet\nof the European Union.\nU.N. human rights spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell called for\nan investigation of the break-in that complied with\ninternational legal procedures.\n(Reporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
