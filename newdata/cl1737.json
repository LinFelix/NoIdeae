Documents obtained by CNN show that the school has forced Clarke to revise his 2013 thesis or else lose his degree in security studies.\n\nAs CNN reported in May, Clarke \"forgot\" to use quotation marks when lifting excerpts from primary documents and outside analysis, ripping off multiple ACLU reports, the Washington Post, and former President George W. Bush's book \"Decision Points,\" among other sources, in his thesis entitled \"Making U.S. security and privacy rights compatible.\"\n\n\"They're saying certain words and phrases I should have put quotation marks around. OK, alright, fine,\" Clarke admitted in May. \"Maybe from a formatting standpoint the thesis isn't perfect, but the content is there.\"\n\n*Jerk off motion*\n\nA letter from the dean of students informed Clarke in July that his thesis violated the school's honor code and gave cowboy until October 23 to revise the paper or else have his degree revoked. It's unclear whether Clarke's done so.\n\nClarke resigned as sheriff and joined a pro-Trump super PAC earlier in September after Chief of Staff John Kelly denied him a White House job, presumably because Kelly prefers employees who know how punctuation works.\n\n[CNN | photo: Getty]","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
