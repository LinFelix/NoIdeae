It almost caused problems for me but everything was cleared as soon as they realised I didn't buy the tickets myself, so I was freed. It is something that could happen to anybody, you just have to be careful\".\n\nSpeaking further he said he knew Dammy Krane was innocent all along, having experienced the same himself.\n\n\"I knew Dammy Krane was going to be freed of the charges against him; but you know when something like this happens, you still have to go to court and clear yourself, and that's what happened in his case. It was just unfortunate that something like that happened. I would say he was at the right place but at the wrong time. He was only going for a show and somehow one or two of the people travelling with him were not clean and it got every other person involved in the scandal. It could have happened to anybody\", he stressed.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
