By contrast, investigations in Brazil, Colombia, Panama and Peru have produced hundreds of charges, including cases against former presidents.\n\nGovernment critics hope the silence will break Friday when Odebrecht is expected to reveal the recipients of its bribes in the Dominican Republic under a deal that protected the Brazilian construction company from prosecution and allowed it to keep doing business in the country.\n\nOdebrecht's executives confessed to U.S. prosecutors that they paid around $788 million to officials in 10 Latin American countries and two more in Africa in order to get multimillion-dollar contracts with local governments.\n\nThey said they spent $92 million on bribes in the Dominican Republic alone as the company won 17 contracts to build highways, dams and a big coal-burning power plant. One of the key figures in the scheme worked as President Danilo Medina's adviser in two presidential campaigns.\n\nWhen Brazil's own corruption investigations began to turn up the heat on Odebrecht in 2014, the company moved its office in charge of handling bribes â\" the innocuously named Bureau of Structural Operations â\" to Santo Domingo, apparently to distance it from Brazilian prosecutors.\n\nAttorney General Jean Alain Rodriguez, a member of the ruling party's central committee, struck a deal with Odebrecht for a $184 million fine and an agreement to protect its executives from prosecution in exchange for information that might be used to prosecute local graft recipients. It's the first deal of its kind Odebrecht reached outside Brazil.\n\nThat has prompted anti-corruption activists to hold marches protesting government inaction and to file court cases demanding an independent investigation. Many say they are pessimistic that Friday's expected announcement will reveal the full extent of corruption in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\"For Odebrecht, the Dominican Republic wasn't just any country,\" said Manuel Robles, a member of the Green Movement, a group created to protest against corruption and is demanding an independent probe into the bribery scheme and audits of all Odebrecht's local contracts.\n\n\"The Dominican people have been vilely affected by a business mafia complicit with politicians and thieving bureaucrats,\" Robles said.\n\nOdebrecht's contracts in the Dominican Republic since 2001 totalled $5 billion â\" 7 per cent of the annual GDP in a country where most people earn $200 a month or less.\n\n\"You can follow the money through here. There must be records, information,\" said Rosalia Sosa, director of the activist group Citizen Participation, which has called for a more thorough investigation.\n\nFifteen of the contracts were signed during the 13-year tenure of Medina's Dominican Liberation Party, now led by former President Leonel Fernandez. The party's popularity is based largely on Latin America's highest rate of economic growth and extensive social programs.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
