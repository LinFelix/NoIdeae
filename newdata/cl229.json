Russia denies Western accusations it fomented the\nconflict and provided arms and fighters.\nThe observers are there to monitor implementation of a peace\ndeal agreed in Minsk in 2015, which has been largely\nunsuccessful in settling the conflict despite German and French\nurgings.\nSome German politicians have said sanctions should be lifted\nif the peace deal is impplemented. Christian Lindner, leader of\nthe Free Democrats, a likely coalition partner for Merkel after\nSept. 24 elections, even suggested Germany must accept Russia's\noccupation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula.\nMerkel said Putin's proposals were \"tender shoots\" of\nprogress, \"which give no cause for softening sanctions\" so far.\nShe rejected Lindner's proposal.\n\"The annexation is against international law and must not be\naccepted,\" she said.\n(Reporting By Thomas Escritt; editing by Ralph Boulton)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
