There was no need for cash to be trucked in from outside the state, as was the case for Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina marooned New Orleans in 2005.\nIrma ripped through the U.S. southeast earlier this week, flooding cities and towns and killing at least 32 in Florida. Nearly 2 million U.S. homes and businesses remain without power.  \nWhile the floods did not threaten the Fed's office just west of Miami, waters did approach the one in downtown Jacksonville though it did not take in water, Gelpi said. A handful of employees at each office stayed overnight as hours were extended to receive, prepare and send out cash orders.\nThere has not yet been a follow-on surge in cash demand, Gelpi said. \"We saw the peak prior to the storm, and now the lull as people came back online and commerce is re-emerging.\"\nLate last month, Hurricane Harvey caused more havoc for the Fed's Houston branch, where cash deliveries were halted amid the flooding and emergency shipments were driven in from San Antonio and Dallas.\n\n (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
