Japan has just 7,000\nquick EV-charging stations, according to the industry ministry.\nThe head of Japan's oil refiners' association, Yasushi\nKimura, said one solution is to combine fuelling services with\nstores selling other household goods.\n\"A decline in the number of gas stands is to a certain\nextent inevitable as long as demand for oil including gasoline\ncontinues to decline,\" Kimura said. \"We would need to think\nabout how to make the gas stands survive in the community by\nmaking them part of the goods store, for example.\"\nIn Shimanto City, with a population of around 35,000 in the\nwest of the country, local residents chipped in to help buy the\narea's only gas stand, which now operates as part of a store\nalso offering home-delivery for goods, said Takehiko Okamura, a\nstore clerk.\n\"This area's elderly people ratio exceeds 50 percent, and\nthe population has decreased by 70 since the store began in\n2006,\" he said. \"So the business is getting tougher every year.\"\nAnd in Kawakami village, also in western Japan, the ageing\nowner of the last pump stand handed the business for free to the\nvillage, and a public cooperative reopened it in April, offering\nvarious services for the elderly, including a mobile\nsupermarket.\n(Reporting by Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
