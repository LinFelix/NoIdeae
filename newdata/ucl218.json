LOUIS, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters poured\ninto St. Louis streets on Friday, and some scuffles erupted,\nafter a Missouri judge acquitted a former white police officer\nwho was charged with murder in the 2011 fatal shooting of a\nblack man.\nWith the National Guard on standby in case of violence,\nauthorities appealed to demonstrators to remain peaceful as they\nprotested the outcome of a case reminiscent of circumstances\nthat spawned racially charged unrest in the nearby suburb of\nFerguson and gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement in\n2014.\nPolice said several protesters threw rocks and water\nbottles, while officers were seen in video footage and by\neyewitnesses dousing at least five people with pepper spray\nabout a block from the courthouse.\nAs night fell, police reported making 13 arrests and said\nfour officers had been assaulted. One group of demonstrators\ntried to enter Interstate 40 but was blocked by police officers\nin riot gear.\nFormer city policeman Jason Stockley, 36, was found not\nguilty of first-degree murder in the shooting death of Anthony\nLamar Smith, 24, in a verdict rendered by a judge five weeks\nafter the end of a non-jury trial. Stockley said Smith fled in\nhis car when the officer tried to arrest him on drug charges.\nStockley and his partner chased Smith, who was shot five\ntimes in his car. The former policeman believed Smith was armed,\ndefense attorneys said. A gun was found in the car, but\nprosecutors argued Stockley planted the weapon and that gun had\nonly Stockley's DNA on it.\nFollowing the verdict, some 600 protesters marched through\ndowntown St. Louis, chanting \"No justice, no peace\" and \"Hey\nhey! Ho ho! These killer cops have got to go!\"\nSome protesters held signs that read \"Black Lives Matter\"\nand \"No more racist killer cops.\"\nLater in the evening, a group of about 300 protesters moved\nfrom the courthouse to the city's popular restaurant\nneighborhood, the Central West End.\n\"I’m sad, I’m hurt, I’m mad,” the Reverend Clinton Stancil\nof the Wayman AME Church in St. Louis said by telephone. “We\nhaven’t made any progress since Ferguson, that’s clear. Cops can\nstill kill us with impunity.\"\nStockley's attorney, Neil Bruntrager, said the ex-officer on\nFriday was relieved and would seek to rebuild his life. “It’s\nbeen a long road for him,” Bruntrager said.\nIn his ruling, Judge Timothy Wilson said the state had\nfailed to prove a charge of murder beyond a reasonable doubt, or\neven a lesser charge such as involuntary manslaughter.\nThe judge also said he doubted the prosecution's claim the\ngun was planted, writing: \"Finally, the court observes, based on\nits nearly 30 years on the bench, that an urban heroin dealer\nnot in possession of a firearm would be an anomaly.\"\nThe comment sparked outrage by protesters on the street and\non social media.\n'THIS AIN'T RIGHT'\nMurder convictions against law enforcement officers are\nrare. In recent years grand juries have declined to even charge\nofficers involved in the 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown,\n18, which triggered waves of violent protests in Ferguson, and\nin the choking death of Eric Garner, 43, in New York. Baltimore\npolice officers were acquitted in the case of Freddie Gray, who\ndied from a broken neck suffered while handcuffed in a police\nvan in 2015.\nBrown's father, Michael Brown Sr., voiced his frustration\nafter Friday's verdict.\n\"You all know this ain't right and you all continue to do\nthis to us,\" he told a St. Louis Fox television station. \"Like\nwe don't mean nothing, like we're rats, trash, dogs in the\nstreets. Right now, I'm praying for my city because my people\nare tired of this.\"\nSt. Louis prosecutor Kimberly Gardner said she was\ndisappointed with the verdict and called on protesters to avoid\nviolence.\n“I understand the verdict has created anger and frustration\nfor many in our community,\" she told reporters at the\ncourthouse. \"I am frustrated as well. Destruction of our\ncommunity is not the answer.\"\nSmith tried to flee from Stockley on Dec. 20, 2011,\nfollowing an alleged drug deal, authorities said. During the\npursuit, Stockley could be heard saying on an internal police\ncar video he was going to kill Smith, prosecutors said.\nAt Stockley's direction, the driver of the police car\nslammed into Smith's vehicle and they came to a stop, court\ndocuments said. Stockley then approached Smith's car and shot\nhim five times with his service weapon.\nStockley waived his right to a jury trial, allowing the\njudge to decide. He left the St. Louis Metropolitan Police\nDepartment in 2013 and was arrested last year.\nSmith's family settled a lawsuit against the city for\n$900,000 in 2013, Watkins said.\n(Additional reporting
