But I had stayed with my hair for almost eight (chemotherapy) sessions.\n\n\"I'm still under treatment. And as you can see, I am responding well to treatment,\" he told the Daily News at his residence.\n\nPatients undergoing chemotherapy often suffer side effects, including nausea and vomiting, which is usually controlled through antipsychotic or anti-vomiting medicine.\n\n\"I was so fortunate, I didn't go through those, vomiting and all that, no I didn't,\" revealed the MDC leader.\n\nThe former prime minister said he was fortunate to be receiving treatment at the best cancer facility in South Africa but was quick to bemoan the steep treatment costs.\n\n\"That is why people die. It's totally unsustainable,\" he said.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
