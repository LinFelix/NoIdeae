It'll be a trip to a disturbing world where society has collapsed, government oppression is rife and technology endangers millions of lives.\n\nOn Earth and out in the far reaches of space, we'll encounter dangerous monsters, invading aliens, synthetic femme fatales, killer cops and masked terrorists.\n\nBut this ambitious sci-fi series - produced by and starring Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston and with an impressive A-list cast - isn't just a vision of dystopian dread. It also looks at themes such as what it means to be human, what separates us from machines and what our place is in the galaxy.\n\n'These are stories of poignancy, warmth and intelligence,' says Bryan.\n\n'I think viewers will relate to them, feel better about themselves and realise things could be worse.\n\n'I want people to get involved, talk about it and think, \"Wow, will it really be like that in the future?\"'\n\nEach episode of the 10-part series is inspired by one of sci-fi novelist Philip K. Dick's short stories. The mini movies are all standalone adventures with different casts. Six will be screened this year with another four to follow in 2018.\n\nIn the opener, The Hood Maker, Richard Madden plays Agent Ross. He's teamed up with Honor (Holliday Grainger), a telepathic being who reads people's inner thoughts.\n\nThey must stop an uprising by rebels fighting for the right to privacy of their own thoughts. 'It deals with trust, love and honesty,' says Richard. 'That said, I wouldn't want to read minds. I've got enough problems of my own without having to cope with anyone else's!'\n\nTo whet your appetite further, here's our round-up of the other five episodes...\n\nReal Life\n\nX-Men actress Anna Paquin is a policewoman who has a creepy bond with a game designer (Terrence Howard).\n\nCrazy Diamond\n\nHollywood star Steve Buscemi plays an ordinary man seduced into crime by an attractive synthetic woman.\n\nImpossible Planet\n\nSpace tourism workers played by Jack Reyno and Benedict Wong try to scam a 345-year-old woman.\n\nHuman\n\nSilas (Bryan Cranston) returns from a space mission to a distant planet a seemingly different man.\n\nThe Commuter\n\nTimothy Spall plays a railway station employee. He discovers that commuters are travelling to a town that shouldn't even exist.\n\nElectric Dreams: Sunday, Channel 4, 9pm","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
