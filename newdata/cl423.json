A dispute between Gorran and the KDP caused the assembly\nto suspend its sessions in 2015.\nMPs from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) attended the\nsession, ensuring the required quorum. The PUK is historic rival\nof the KDP but is supporting the referendum plan.\nIranian-backed Iraqi Shi'ite paramilitary groups have\nthreatened to dislodge the Kurdish forces from the oil-rich\nKirkuk region, which is due to take part in the referendum.\nKirkuk is home to sizeable Arab and Turkmen populations and\nis outside the KRG official boundaries. The Kurds claim it as\npart of their homeland.\nKurdish peshmerga fighters seized Kirkuk and other disputed\nterritories when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic\nState in 2014. The Kurdish move prevented Kirkuk's oilfields\nfrom falling in the hands of the militants.\n\"We've been waiting for more than 100 years\" to have a\nstate, KDP MP Omed Khoshnaw told Reuters after the vote.\n\"There is no other way to guarantee that genocide will never\nbe repeated,'' he told the assembly earlier, referring to the\npersecution of the Kurds and their expulsion from areas\nincluding Kirkuk under former president Saddam Hussein.\n(Reporting by Raya Jalabi; Editing by Maher Chmaytelli and\nAngus MacSwan)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
