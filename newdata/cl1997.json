Children pick up garments that land on the muddy ground, dust them down and bundle them into empty rice bags.\n\nOne Rohingya man wearing the traditional lungi tied around his waist picks up a new-looking pair of jeans embellished with red sequins and places them on his head for protection against the sun.\n\n- Safety concerns -\n\nMohamad Anisul Islam, a 23-year-old Bangladeshi art student, is one of those standing atop the trucks throwing out aid.\n\nHe insists his government is doing all it can for the refugees, but says he wants to help with the desperate situation.\n\n\"Their condition is miserable. They have no food, no home, none of their basic human rights are being met,\" he said.\n\n\"We already have a big population in Bangladesh and we want them to go home, but while they are here we want to help.\"\n\nVivian Tan, spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency, said the government was now trying to set up drop-off points for aid distribution due to concerns over the current ad-hoc arrangements.\n\n\"It reflects the generosity of the Bangladeshi public but did raise concerns about the safety of the refugees rushing for aid being tossed off trucks,\" she told AFP.\n\n\"The sheer scale of this growing influx and the fact that they are scattered in different locations -- camps, makeshift sites and local villages -- make it hard to know where they all are and to reach them all equitably.\"\n\nBangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said the army would be deployed to distribute aid, while Lieutenant Colonel Rashidul Hasan told AFP on Friday the orders had reached the crisis zone.\n\n\"We've got the directive that the army would receive relief materials sent by foreign nations at the airport and take it to Cox's Bazar,\" he said.\n\nFor years Bangladesh restricted the UN refugee agency from operating outside the two camps that are home to the small minority of refugees with government registration papers.\n\nIt refused to register new entries, reluctant to give them an incentive to stay on.\n\nOverwhelmed by a tide of arrivals that shows no sign of stopping, it has softened its stance and begun the process of registering newcomers -- even as it presses Myanmar to end the violence and take them back.\n\nMyanmar, a mainly Buddhist country that views the Rohingya as illegal immigrants, shows no sign of doing so.\n\nAlthough it remains unclear what benefits registration will bring for the refugees, thousands are turning out in droves to be fingerprinted, photographed and documented.\n\n\"I haven't had any proper aid yet,\" 70-year-old refugee Faisal Karim told AFP as he squatted in the long queue for registration by the army at the Kutupalong camp.\n\n\"I think that when we are registered we will get proper relief, like the refugees who have been here a long time.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
