Buffett replaces Thomas Schneider, the sheriff since 2008, who is retiring immediately.\n\"I look forward to serving our citizens and our Sheriff's Office employees in a broader capacity,\" Buffett said in a statement.\nHoward Buffett is also a director at Berkshire Hathaway Inc and expected to become the conglomerate's non-executive chairman after Warren Buffett, 87, is no longer in charge.\nBoth father and son are also big philanthropists. Howard Buffett has pledged most of the roughly $235 million of Berkshire stock he owns to charity, a regulatory filing shows.\nBefore his promotion on Friday, Howard Buffett had completed more than 3,300 hours of patrol and training, and had 76 weapons qualifications including Tasers, handguns, rifles and shotguns.\nAn assistant to Warren Buffett did not immediately respond to requests for comment about his son's new job.\n\n (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
