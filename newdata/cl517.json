We won't be stopping.\"\nThe office of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, which defended the law, had no immediate comment.\nIn January 2015, U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles agreed with the law's opponents that the federal Poultry Products Inspection Act preempted it.\nBut in Friday's decision, Circuit Judge Jacqueline Nguyen said California was simply trying to ban a feeding method it deemed cruel and inhumane.\nShe said this posed no conflict with the federal law, even if it effectively banned foie gras in the state.\n\"Nothing in the federal law or its implementing regulations limits a state's ability to regulate the types of poultry that may be sold for human consumption,\" Nguyen wrote.\nJared Goodman, a lawyer for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said the decision \"prohibits selling diseased livers of birds force-fed by jamming tubes down their throat and pumping concentrated food down their esophagus. This is truly torture and unimaginable cruelty.\"\n\n (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Richard Leong in New York, and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Diane
