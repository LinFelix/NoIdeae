She has previously worked as a judicial inspector and appeal judge at the Amman Court of Appeal, as well as a president for the Legal Network for Arab Women, which is a regional non-governmental and non-profit organization that supports Arab women working in legal professions.\n\nAn idol for all Jordanians, both men and women.\n\nCongratulations.
