Our gratitude goes to our colleagues on the SRP Committee and other staff who helped the children throughout the program. The theme of this year's Summer Reading Program was \"Build a Better World.\" The children and young adults who took part in the program reflected on the ways they can make a difference in the world around them while they continued to pursue reading and learning through the summer months.\n\nThis year, we are proud to report that we logged a significant increase in participation in the program: 1,146 children of different ages participated in all programs, an increase of over 20 percent from last year; 665 youngsters--that's 24 percent more than last year--read a total of 11,233 books, which is over 30 percent more than in 2016; and in a very exciting benchmark, the SRP youth read over one million pages--which is nearly 60 percent more pages than last year! In addition to hundreds of hours of reading, children enjoyed computer activities, crafts, games, movies and field trips.\n\nWe were delighted to host events and presentations throughout the summer, including a magic show by Francis Menotti, yoga instruction by Jamie Wilson Murray, and hands-on science learning with Mad Science of Union and Hudson. All of the presentations were educational, interactive, and lots of fun. To entertain as many children as possible, each show was held at up to six different library locations across the city. In addition, we took a total of 167 children and young adults on three field trips, with different groups going to Medieval Times, iPlay America, and Turtle Back Zoo.\n\nThe SRP is a team effort, and it is our pleasure to give special thanks to those individuals who were instrumental in making this year's program a success. In particular, we are grateful for the efforts of Freeholder Bill O'Dea, Freeholder Clerk Al Santos, and Hudson County Schools of Technology Transportation Supervisor Israel Salgado, for arranging the bus transport to and from the field trips. We would also like to recognize and thank the Jersey City Free Public Library Board of Trustees for finding the funds to increase our budget, which made it possible for us to schedule more trips and to recognize the participants with celebrations at the end of the program.\n\nOnce again, we would like to thank the Library SRP committee members for their enthusiasm, hard work, and for using their skills and knowledge to enrich the lives of our children in the Jersey City community. And of course, our biggest thanks goes to the children and young adults who participated in this year's SRP! We can't wait to do it again next year!\n\nMary Quinn, Branch Manager of Cunningham Library\n\nSen. Menendez should be suspended\n\nSenator Menendez should not be given special treatment during his trial. Instead he should not be allowed to make any votes that concern \"we the people.\"\n\nIt's ludicrous to have a person on alleged criminal charges vote a \"yea or nay\" that may concern our well-being. He, like other public officials, should be suspended until the trial is over.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
