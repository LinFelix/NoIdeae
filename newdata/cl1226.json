She said the awards night had taken her \"back to the 1970s\".\n\n\"What played out tonight, is the dark side of our country. Where a team of female teenagers sat patiently to be recognised as athletes. A team which included 5 Regional Rep team players (which in itself deserved recognition by the club, but wasn't). Some of these players so dedicated to the sport they played in 4 teams over the season, trained and played 12 hours a week and up to 7 competitive games per week.\n\nAccording to Grundy, the young female athletes were \"sideline by the ol' boys club\" - \"men who preferred to spend the evening recognising their mates over athletes; whose teams were not limited by the club to 1 award per team (as our Netball team was). But to 5 awards, per team, each. In fact one award was named \"Dick of the week\" and the other \"Players player\" (whatever that means)\".\n\nSpeaking to the NZ Herald, Grundy says the girls in the team are still shocked by what happened.\n\n\"My daughter is 13-years-old, she practices two hours a day and plays seven games a week,\" she said.\n\n\"She'd never experienced this before.\"\n\n\"The biggest lesson for us is to research a culture behind a club before joining,\" she said.\n\n\"We only joined [the Silverdale club] because of coach Katie Sylvester,\" she explains, adding that they should have looked more into the club's culture.\n\nGrundy says several parents at the awards, including many fathers, were shocked by what they witnessed.\n\n\"A lot of these girls are aspiring Silver Ferns,\" she said, adding that, not wanting to take away from the boys, they did deserve more recognition.\n\nShe says the club's attitude is a symptom of \"New Zealand putting rugby above anything else\". She says sexism definitely plays a part.\n\nSilverdale United Rugby and Sports Club chairman Dave Wrathall rejected accusations of sexism when speaking to Fairfax and said that the club had been involved in rugby since the 1960s, with many donating trophies and sponsoring specific achievements. The netball club was formed in 2008, he added.\n\n\"The board totally rejects any allegation of sexism, and quite the reverse advocates strongly for female involvement at all age groups and participation levels.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
