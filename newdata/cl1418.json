The next steps will probably focus on the mechanics of implementation,' he added.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the continent would secure a high-quality CFTA that delivers real results and see its exports within Africa beat every record seen in its history.\n\nHe said Africa have shown an impressive ability to adapt and to thrive.\n\nNana Dankwawoso expressed the hope that the conference recommendations to be presented to the African Union leader would help address private sector concerns with the CFTA and deepen intra-Africa trade for our mutual benefits.\n\nDr David Luke, the Coordinator for the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), said the realization of the CFTA policy would transform Africa's economy and would create decent jobs for about one million people under the 54 member countries.\n\nDr Luke said the CFTA would include a GDP of 150 trillion US dollars and would see a reduction in tariffs for business owners under the CFTA.\n\n'The CFTA will include 54 African countries and will have a combine population of one million people,'' he added.\n\nHe said ''women must be provided better protection along the corridors of the CFTA and that participating government must ensure that African women and youth are better placed to participate and gain from the benefits from the CFTA''.\n\nHe said the African market was of great interest to foreign partners so opportunities provided by the CFTA should be capitalised on by both small and large African businesses.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
