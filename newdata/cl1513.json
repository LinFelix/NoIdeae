As such we expect to sign an agreement that will allow greater exchange with Jamaica and its world renowned sports community,\" she informed.\n\nAmbassador Jaber said that Mexico recognizes Jamaica as an important partner and a driving force for the development of the Caribbean.\n\nJamaica and Mexico established diplomatic relations in March 1965.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
