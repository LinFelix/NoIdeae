She's a\nprofane 45-year-old woman struggling with alcohol and substance\nabuse, and she spent time in prison for murdering the Grinch,\nwho was once her husband and fathered her daughter.\nDr. Seuss Enterprises accused Lombardo of exploiting the\ncharacters and themes of \"Grinch\" because he was too lazy to try\n\"working up something fresh.\"\nBut the judge said Lombardo turned the saccharine depictions\nof Who-Ville into an object of ridicule, where green beasts\nimpregnate women, paparazzi \"run rabid,\" and citizens get high\non \"Who Hash\" to avoid life's daily hassles.\n\"The play's coarseness and vulgarity lampoons 'Grinch' by\nhighlighting the ridiculousness of the utopian society depicted\nin the original work: society is not good and sweet, but coarse,\nvulgar and disappointing,\" wrote Hellerstein, who was born in\n1933 during the Great Depression.\n\"The play would not make sense without evoking the style and\nmessage of \"Grinch,' for which there would be no object of the\nparody,\" Hellerstein added. \"Whether the play's parody of\n'Grinch' is effective, or in good taste, is irrelevant.\"\nThe case is Lombardo et al v Dr. Seuss Enterprises LP, U.S.\nDistrict Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-09974.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Cynthia\nOsterman)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
