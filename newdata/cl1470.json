They try to steal from parents despite the warnings from the government that nobody should collect money from anybody. Government is paying for the fees of these children and some headmasters are bent on flouting these guidelines; these headmasters will not even come to terms with their demotion to go back to the classrooms to teach with good intentions,\" he fumed.\n\nThe Ghana Education Service (GES) sacked two Senior High School headmasters for extorting money from students despite strict directives from the Ministry of Education not to do so.\n\nIn a statement signed by the Director General of the GES, Prof Kwasi Opoku-Amankwa, he stated that the two headmasters: Mr Biasu Wisdom of Pentecost SHS and Assistant Headmaster of Daffour SHS, Rev. S.P. Elewokor are 'relieved' of their post.\n\nThe statement partly read; \"On the basis of the interaction with the various Heads of Schools who were summoned to Accra on alleged infractions against the guidelines on the implementation of the free Senior High School programme, the following decisions were also taken:\n\nMrs. Florence Prah, Headmistress of Kwanyako Senior High School, Mrs Mercy Ocloo, Headmistress of Ahantaman Senior High School, Mr. Julian Okun, the Headmaster of the Akumfi Ameyaw Senior High School, Techiman; Mr Jacob Boateng, Assistant Headmaster and Mr. George Frimpong Kwarteng all of the same school; as well as Mr Christian Attram Gyetekey, Headmaster of Asesewa Senior High School are to be interdicted pending further investigations into the allegation against them.\n\nMr Biasu Wisdom, the Headmaster of Pentecost Senior High School, Koforidua is relieved of his position as Head of the school and is to be posted outside the school to teach in the classroom.\n\nRev. S.P Elewokor, the Assistant Headmaster of Daffour Senior High School is relieved of his post and is to be posted outside the school to teach in a classroom, while the Headmaster of the school, Mr S.C.K Agbakey is to be reprimanded for poor supervision\".","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
