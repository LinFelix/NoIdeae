Buffett replaces Thomas Schneider, the sheriff since 2008, who is retiring immediately.\n\"I look forward to serving our citizens and our Sheriff's Office employees in a broader capacity,\" Buffett said in a statement.\nHoward Buffett is also a director at Berkshire Hathaway Inc and expected to become the conglomerate's non-executive chairman after Warren Buffett, 87, is no longer in charge.\nBoth father and son are also big philanthropists. Howard Buffett has pledged most of the roughly $235 million of Berkshire stock he owns to charity, a regulatory filing shows.\nIn an email, Warren Buffett said he supports his son's latest undertaking. \n\"Whatever Howie takes on he'll do well,\" Buffett said. \"I'm sure it will not diminish activity for his philanthropy or the Berkshire board. Howie has unlimited energy.\"\nBefore his promotion on Friday, Howard Buffett had completed more than 3,300 hours of patrol and training, and had 76 weapons qualifications including Tasers, handguns, rifles and shotguns.\n\n (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by David Gregorio)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 10:47:12.775"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 10:47:12.482","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|nX9mmd3osA9QRF\/sEqq3KaO7F\/k=|WaCOiMe4c6cDNnCOzIUz0hwyM1oae6sMW7ZWtQXIczZaBCbe\/VvZ8w==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/5cf5c223-f65b-3dd5-8d3b-3cf8b66898be\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.874,"name":"Law_Crime"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/5cf5c223-f65b-3dd5-8d3b-3cf8b66898be\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/5cf5c223-f65b-3dd5-8d3b-3cf8b66898be\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/5cf5c223-f65b-3dd5-8d3b-3cf8b66898be\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/acd44d54-d8f3-3c36-a78c-2da2af5a2ae8","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Finance","importance":"1","originalValue":"Finance"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/5cf5c223-f65b-3dd5-8d3b-3cf8b66898be\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/5cf5c223-f65b-3dd5-8d3b-3cf8b66898be\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/9efd0bee-0479-336f-a246-d987f6406804","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Business","importance":"1","originalValue":"Business"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/5cf5c223-f65b-3dd5-8d3b-3cf8b66898be\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/5cf5c223-f65b-3dd5-8d3b-3cf8b66898be\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/f1af9688-5498-363e-9052-be898dce559c","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Money","importance":"1","originalValue":"Money"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/5cf5c223-f65b-3dd5-8d3b-3cf8b66898be\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/5cf5c223-f65b-3dd5-8d3b-3cf8b66898be\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/eca93eed-370a-37cc-a462-dda0ee0ecf28","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Buffett","importance":"2","originalValue":"Buffett"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/5cf5c223-f65b-3dd5-8d3b-3cf8b66898be\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/5cf5c223-f65b-3dd5-8d3b-3cf8b66898be\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/d628e674-1472-3de3-83f9-1e850ff889a8","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Berkshire Hathaway","importance":"2","originalValue":"Berkshire Hathaway"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/5cf5c223-f65b-3dd5-8d3b-3cf8b66898be\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/5cf5c223-f65b-3dd5-8d3b-3cf8b66898be\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/b0d1debf-46e5-39c5-bd43-66e9f34478ca","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Howard Graham Buffett","importance":"2","originalValue":"Howard Graham Buffett"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/5cf5c223-f65b-3dd5-8d3b-3cf8b66898be\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Property & Casualty Insurance -
