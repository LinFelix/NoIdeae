It so beautifully combines all that with the visual,\" he said. \"For me, it was a beautiful entrance into the world of history.\"\n\nStudents in the class must memorize 250 images, and Spangler has them sketch images of the art on flashcards, along with notes on the form, function, content and context of each work.\n\nThe district offers about 25 AP courses in subjects such as English, economics, science and world language, said district curriculum director Takako Olson.\n\nThe art history class is similar to the survey courses offered in college, Spangler said, and that struck a cord with me.\n\nAs a college freshman, a dear friend and I signed up for those and loved them. As it turns out, my friend made art history her life's work. I didn't, but I've loved art since, and those old, dusty art history textbooks are still on my bookshelves.\n\nMaybe one of those students will be similarly inspired. Here's my tip: The Venus de Milo is the one with no arms.\n\nComing full circle\n\nSixteen years ago on Sept. 11, Jake Bogus walked into his eighth-grade U.S. history class in Minden and learned terrorists had flown planes into the World Trade Center.\n\nHis favorite teacher was staring at the television screen.\n\n\"He said, 'Today in class we're just going to watch the news because our country has been attacked. This is going to be in your history books someday,'\" Bogus recalled.\n\nFast forward to Sept. 11, 2017, and Bogus has his own eighth-grade U.S. history class at Schoo Middle School, and is taking time on the anniversary of the attacks to teach about them.\n\n\"It's one of the very few things my students can ask me about and I can remember it firsthand: where I was and how I felt,\" he said.\n\nThey discuss what happened -- none of those students were alive then -- and Bogus talks to them about \"flashbulb memories,\" those events so significant people remember in detail what they were doing when they found out.\n\nLike walking into your eighth-grade U.S. history class with no earthly idea you'd be talking to your own eighth-grade history class about it one day.\n\nBeing prepared Sign up for our daily news email\n\nThe top headlines from JournalStar.com.

Officials have identified temporary sites -- such as a church -- near each school where students would go to wait for buses to take them to Southwest.\n\nOnce there, students would stay in the gym, where movies, games and toys are stored nearby and available to keep them occupied. Parents would be directed to an area where LPS officials could verify their relationship to the student. Nurses, social workers, psychologists and interpreters would be on hand to help.\n\nStaff would return kids to their parents in a separate hallway, and a private area is designated where parents would be told if their child had been injured.\n\nThe idea, LPS officials said, is to create a controlled environment to keep everyone calm, give parents privacy if there's bad news and make sure LPS safely reunites parents with their families.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
