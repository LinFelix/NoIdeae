They'll be getting DNA test kits.\n\nFans who attend Sunday's game can submit a sample by swabbing inside their cheeks and placing it in a bin at the stadium. The Boston-based biotech firm that is giving the free kits out says the assessment offers \"insight into your mind, body and health.\"\n\nHowever, this sort of genetic testing is the subject of scientific debate.\n\nToni Pollin, an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, told The Baltimore Sun that \"the tests they're talking about doing are not going to be
