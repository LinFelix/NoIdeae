They will be renamed vocational training centres and the personnel in such institutions must attain proper training at the Technical Training Centre in Nairobi.\n\nThis comes in the wake of the governmentâs move to establish a full-fledged authority to manage technical training institutions.\n\nThe authority will, among other things,provide relevant programmes and effective management and governance for technical education.\n\nThis ensures that youths are not only educated but are equipped with the relevant skills to drive the nation to the technological era.\n\nThe justification of coming up with new TTIs is premised on the fact that more youths should have access to quality tertiary education and basic skills that would make them self-reliant.\n\nThe new institutions have been established to provide increased access for our youths who are yearning for tertiary education and to provide skilled middle-level manpower for national development.\n\nThe current shortage of artisans, plumbers and technologists is due to failure by previous governments to prioritise the development of technical education.\n\nBut with Jubilee putting more emphasis on technical education, youths will get the right type of training that would empower them to become job creators and active players in the economy.\n\nWhat the administration is doing is redefining education and giving youths the knowledge and skills to effectively compete and face the challenges in the current job market.\n\nYouths only complain of lack of employment opportunities, even though the majority lack the relevant skills to contribute to national development.\n\nIt is encouraging that the administration is directing more resources to research activities for the benefit of the learning institutions and the country at large.\n\nMany developed countries have are far ahead in terms of information technology because more resources are directed towards the development of research.\n\nThe renewed focus on vocational and technical education by the Jubilee administration is one of the best strategies in meeting the needs of the Kenyan youth in the job market.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
