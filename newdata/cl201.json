LUMPUR, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The movie company that\nmade \"The Wolf of Wall Street\", and was co-founded by the\nMalaysian prime minister's step son, has settled a civil lawsuit\nbrought by the U.S. government to seize assets allegedly bought\nwith money stolen from a Malaysian state fund.\nRed Granite Pictures announced the settlement in a filing at\nthe federal Los Angeles court on Friday, without revealing any\nsum.\nU.S prosecutors, pursuing a kleptocracy asset recovery\ninitiative, had claimed the 2013 film, directed by Martin\nScorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was financed by Red\nGranite using funds stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad\n(1MDB).\n\"The parties are pleased to inform the court that Red Granite\nand the government have reached a settlement in principle,\" the\nfiling stated.\nRed Granite has said previously that neither it, or its\nco-founder Riza Aziz, had done anything wrong.\nThe U.S. Justice Department has lodged dozens of lawsuits in\nthe past two years related to the alleged misappropriation of\n$4.5 billion from the investment fund, 1MDB.\nThe United States is seeking to seize some $1.7 billion in\nassets, making it the largest action brought by the department\nunder its kleptocracy asset recovery initiative.\nThe scandal has dogged Prime Minister Najib Razak, who had\nchaired 1MDB's advisory board until it was dismantled last year,\nbut he has consistently denied any wrong doing related to the\nfund.\nWhile Najib has not been the subject of any of the lawsuits,\na number of his close associates, including step son Riza Aziz,\nhave been named by U.S. investigators.\nBoth U.S. and Malaysian officials have confirmed however,\nthat Najib is the \"Malaysian Official Number 1\" referred to in\nFederal Bureau of Investigation reports.\nRed Granite Pictures provided no details of the settlement,\nwhich the filing said remains subject to final documentation and\nnecessary approvals within the government.\nThe settlement also covers claims against Red Granite's\nrights and interests in two other pictures, \"Daddyâ€™s Home\" and\n\"Dumb and Dumber To.\"\nPotential witnesses in 1MDB cases are afraid to speak with\nU.S. investigators as they fear for their safety, the Federal\nBureau of Investigation said earlier this month.\nThe U.S. lawsuits have also sought to seize a Picasso\npainting given to American movie star Leonardo DiCaprio and\nmillions of dollars worth of jewellery give to Australian model\nand actress Miranda Kerr, all allegedly from 1MDB funds.\nNajib met U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House\nearlier this week, but both leaders steered clear of addressing\nthe American investigation into the 1MDB scandal.\n(Reporting by Praveen Menon; Editing by Simon cameron-Moore)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
