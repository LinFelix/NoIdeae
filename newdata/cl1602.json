(AP) -- Springfield businesswoman Melissa Gelner says Gov. Eric Greitens has withdrawn her appointment to Missouri Board of Education.\n\nGelner says she was notified Friday about the governor's decision. She said in a statement that she was frustrated with the Greitens' policy team and his office's relationship with the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.\n\nThe Springfield News-Leader reports Gelner said she was pressured to make \"rash leadership decisions\" on the board, but she did not elaborate in her statement. She said she had seen little effort from the governor's office to collaborate with DESE to work for public schools.\n\nThe education board's main duty is selecting the state's Commissioner of Education.\n\nGelner, who is involved with Springfield-based programs that serve children, was appointed to the board in late July.\n\n-- -- --\n\nInformation from: Springfield News-Leader,
