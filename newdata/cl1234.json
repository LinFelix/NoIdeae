My Director-General has also apologised on behalf of the department.\"\n\nBut opposition child safety spokeswoman Ros Bates said saying sorry wasn't good enough.\n\n\"As we reflect on Child Protection Week, we need to ensure the premier holds her minister accountable for the litany of failures,\" she told parliament.\n\n\"Premier, sack this minister today.\"\n\nMs Bates also raised concerns about how many other similar cases there were on the department's books.\n\nThe case surfaced amid separate reports about a Gold Coast woman who learned via Facebook - not Corrective Services - that her violent ex-partner had been released early from jail.\n\nThe opposition has also called for Corrective Services Minister Mark Ryan's scalp over that case.\n\nBut Ms Palaszczuk insisted there should be unity in parliament when it came to domestic violence cases.\n\n\"I honestly believe domestic and family violence shouldn't be a political issue, it should be something that we all work together to address,\" she told parliament.\n\n\"Unfortunately there are times when people fall below those cracks, and we need to do everything we can to help rebuild their lives.\"\n\nOpposition Leader Tim Nicholls said his party supported measures to stamp out domestic violence, but couldn't ignore the situation.\n\n\"Let's not mince words - both of these breaches could have led to the death of another Queensland woman at the hands of a violent partner or the abduction of vulnerable children,\" he said.\n\nNational domestic violence helpline: 1800 737 732 or 1800RESPECT. In an emergency call triple-zero.\n\nReaders seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
