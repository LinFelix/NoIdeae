They fear increased tensions between Baghdad and Erbil will distract from the war on Islamic State militants who still occupy parts of Iraq and Syria.\n\"We still haven't heard a proposal that can be an alternative to the Kurdistan referendum,\" Barzani told a rally in the Kurdish region, referring to a proposal put forward by the U.S. and other Western envoys this week.\nIraq's neighbors Iran and Turkey also oppose the plebiscite, fearing an independent Kurdish state could fuel separatism among their own Kurdish populations.\nThe opposition Gorran movement boycotted Friday's parliamentary session, the first since a dispute between them and Barzani's KDP caused the suspension of the assembly in October 2015.\n\"Those assembled in parliament today think this is a lawful session, but this is unlawful,\" Birzu Majeed, the head of Gorran's parliamentary block, told a news conference held while parliament was in session. \nLawmakers from a third party, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), ensured the required quorum. The PUK is a historic rival of the KDP but supports the referendum plan.\nMeanwhile, Iranian-backed Iraqi Shi'ite paramilitary groups have threatened to dislodge the Kurdish forces from the Kirkuk region, which is due to take part in the referendum.\nKirkuk is home to sizeable Arab and Turkmen populations and lies outside the official boundaries of the Kurdistan region. It is claimed by both the Kurds and the central government in Baghad.\nKurdish peshmerga fighters seized Kirkuk and other disputed territories when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic State in 2014, preventing its oilfields from falling into militant hands.\n\n (Reporting by Raya Jalabi; Editing by Maher Chmaytelli and Gareth Jones)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
