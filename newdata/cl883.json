The doctor and his supporters believe the condition is caused by jabs\n\n'If it's less than 90-95 per cent you do have susceptibility build up, and then you have outbreaks,' he said.\n\n'It does worry me when I start seeing outbreaks in developed countries. That shouldn't happen.\n\n'Are developed countries moving away from vaccines? Yes, and one of the reasons is we don't see the diseases any more.\n\n'People think they aren't relevant. They're not seeing people die from these diseases.\n\n'The second thing that has happened is the experts don't have the same credibility.'\n\nAndrew Wakefield sparked concerns by suggesting that vaccines could cause autism\n\nThe anti-vaccine movement was given support by celebrities including actor Robert De Niro and former Playboy model Jenny McCarthy.\n\nDr Berkley said middle-class 'Whole Foods mums' were also adding to the problem.\n\n'We're really in trouble when a Playboy bunny has the same authority as the American Academy of Paediatrics,' he said.\n\n'The problem is that we equate the expert with some of the denialists.\n\n'It's the Whole Foods mums; you're trying to be organic, you're trying to do the right thing for your kids and all of a sudden you're like 'well, do I need to inject these things? Is it really a risk?\n\nFormer Playboy model Jenny McCarthy was among celebrities who gave support to the anti-vaccine movement\n\n'My children are fully vaccinated and I would consider myself to not be a good parent if I didn't do that. How do we get that mentality?'\n\nHe said people who think measles is relatively harmless should consider complications that can 'turn your brain into liquid'.\n\n''I don't care what hospital you're in or how rich you are, that happens to you, you are dead,' he said.\n\n'The issue is the average kid does get better if he's well-nourished, but occasionally people die and also the disease spreads and the kid who's just had cancer treatment and is immunosuppressed [is in danger].'\n\nDr Berkley said a British drop in vaccine coverage for diptheria, tetanus and meningitis C was evidence MMR scepticism had 'bled to other vaccines'.\n\nBut health bosses believe administrative disruption caused the dip, rather than anti-vaccine sentiment.\n\nThey pledged to boost coverage through campaigns and 2016-17 figures will be released on Wednesday.\n\nPublic Health England's head of immunisation, Mary Ramsay, said: 'We are working closely with the NHS and with staff in general practice, where most vaccinations are delivered, to improve uptake.'","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
