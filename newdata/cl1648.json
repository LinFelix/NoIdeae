The school failed to observe the basic security measures as stipulated by the board.\n\n\"From the entire sequence of events it appears that the school is guilty of gross negligence and failed to ensure safety and security of students in its schools,\" the notice said.\n\nThe school authorities have been asked to respond within 15 days on why its provisional affiliation should not be withdrawn for wilful violation of provisions of CBSE by-laws.\n\nThe probe panel said the school had no provision of toilets for drivers, conductors and cleaners and they were using the facilities meant for students and staff.\n\nThe CBSE notice also pointed out a safety breach in the school boundary wall (covered with barbed wires), which, the committee observed, is a threat to children's safety as anybody can enter the campus.\n\nThe panel noted the insufficient number of CCTV cameras and said most of the installed cameras did not work.\n\n\"School failed to discharge its responsibility to file FIR and inform District Education Officer and CBSE after knowing the incident,\" the board said, adding that the FIR was subsequently filed by a parent.\n\nThe two members of the panel were Y Arun Kumar, deputy commissioner, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, and Kailash Chand, principal, Govt Co-ed Senior Secondary School, Preet Vihar.\n\nThe Haryana government on Friday ordered a CBI probe into the murder and announced that it would take over the administration of the school for three months.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
