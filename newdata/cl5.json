It is a short-sighted move to take protectionist measures amid sluggish global growth.\"\n\"Chinese investment is not 'Trojan Horse' with hidden purposes,\" it said.\nTrump is set to visit China in November.\n\"The two countries need to strengthen dialogue and communication, promote cooperation and exchanges in various fields and properly handle issues of common concerns. Only then can China and the United States push forward the world's most important bilateral relationship,\" Xinhua said. \n\n (Reporting by John Ruwitch; Editing by SImon
