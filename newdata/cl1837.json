Consider just a few: Gaston, Young, Stemmons, Good, Cabell, Ewing, etc. What about Record Street, named after J.K.P. Record, a lawyer and noted district attorney. He was also a Confederate veteran -- should a committee investigate this?\n\nWould it not be a better use of any available public money to spend it on improving the streets and neighborhoods of all of Dallas? There are some that could benefit from such expenditures, and it wouldn't contribute to dividing the city.\n\nBut, in any case, I am reminded of a quote from a notable philosopher, \"Nothing is more terrible than to see ignorance in action.\" The News article is a start toward changing the current path.\n\nKudos for this article. My own research has revealed more than 30 streets in Dallas that were named after Confederates and this article adds more. These men for whom the streets were named were woven into the very fiber of Dallas history. This shows how foolish and uninformed the City Council was in the rush to remove Gen. Robert E. Lee's statue.\n\nHeritage tourism is one of the major industries of the state, if not the biggest. How many visitors want to visit a city that has streets named First, Second, Third and so on? Visitors want to know the history of an area, \"warts\" and all.\n\nHow much cost and confusion would be inflicted upon the citizenry in changing Coit Road, Gaston Avenue, Harwood Street, Junius Street, Peak Street, Good-Latimer Expressway and many others?\n\nThe City Council may have won the battle by removing Lee's statue but we can win the war at the ballot box when election time comes.\n\nTo all the people bellyaching about erasing history by removing a statue that has become a symbol of racism, you should have voted to support Dallas ISD to buy more textbooks, replace infrastructure and pay teachers so they can actually teach history in their schools.\n\nIf you are really worried about changing history, then invest in everyone's education, including your own.\n\nThe president should decree Sept. 11 a national holiday known as \"First Responders Day\" in honor of those first responders who sacrificed for the good of country and their fellow Americans. More than any other country, America is blessed to have such heroes.\n\nThe American public and Congress would be in favor of such a holiday, even if it meant replacing one of our current holidays.\n\nI am having a hard time figuring out what exactly the texting while driving ban does to improve safety on roadways.\n\nIf you take a trip up or down U.S. 75, like I do every single day, you'll see plenty of people still willing to play Russian roulette with their cellphones.\n\nYou would think with the amount of people still continuing to text and drive that the Dallas Police Department would have enough revenue from citations to fund the department for 10 years.\n\nRe: \"Porn video 'liked' by Cruz account,\" Wednesday news story.\n\nIt's amazing how people misjudge Republicans based on stereotypes and that Republicans are somehow all uncool. Someone with access to Sen. Ted Cruz's Twitter account proved them wrong this week when he clicked on the \"Like\" button for a porno movie on Twitter.\n\nPeople think it's the Dems who are porn-friendly, but when you really compare Democrat and Republican sex scandals, the Republicans win. So I'm going to follow @TedCruz on Twitter!\n\nIn the past I have been an admirer of Sen. John McCain, primarily due to his heroism as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. His father and grandfather were admirals and fleet commanders.\n\nIn early 1993, before my first return trip to Korea, I went to a Navy seminar in Penascola, Fla., where I took a few photos. One was of McCain speaking with former admirals and another of Duane Thorin, a former helicopter pilot who rescued downed fliers, was captured and made a prisoner of war by the North Koreans\/Chinese. I had the honor of meeting with Thorin in the parking lot after the seminar and speaking at length with him.\n\nGetting back to McCain. I cannot understand what he is currently doing politically. It is as if he has taken upon himself the goal of destroying President Donald Trump. During the Vietnam War, he was a patriot. Now, it appears that the McCain I admired died in that prison camp.\n\nRe: \"Dallas among few that could handle Amazon's HQ,\" Sept. 10 Business story.\n\nIt would be awesome for the city of Dallas to land Amazon. I think we have the perfect place for them to develop -- Fair Park. As a new resident to Dallas, I am amazed that Fair Park has not been revitalized. It is a awesome place and has such a great location to the city of Dallas and South Dallas. It would totally elevate Dallas.\n\nDallas is a great place to live and work. People are friendly and optimistic.\n\nI hope the mayor and City Council take a look at this opportunity. Think BIG!\n\nRe: \"Judge blocks Elliott suspension -- NFL likely to protest ruling in appeals court,\" Sept. 9 news story.\n\nSadly, the story regarding Ezekiel Elliott's blocked suspension that will probably allow him to play the whole 2017 season is familiar. Whether at Baylor University or some other football venue, the football players play on while their victims are ignored.\n\nElliott's NFL hearing was said to be \"unfair.\" Where is the fairness for the women abused by football players?\n\nEven our secretary of education appears to be more concerned about the perpetrators of crimes against women than the women themselves.\n\nUntil the game of football becomes less important than these victims of crime, we will not see justice for the women.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 19:59:18.673"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 19:59:17.717","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|XOeel996XkwwgUWDaEkdPT35fnA=|PRn27Mq5MYeixmgzYqp7NG41\/BVwK0E0\/8xPN1rzzs9zRR6MGmIPGA==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/60ca069d-5c5a-315b-be3b-329bd3378c60\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/60ca069d-5c5a-315b-be3b-329bd3378c60\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/60ca069d-5c5a-315b-be3b-329bd3378c60\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/c3df1101-0b09-37b1-89c4-540c1143c61d","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Military personnel","importance":"1","originalValue":"Military personnel"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/60ca069d-5c5a-315b-be3b-329bd3378c60\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/60ca069d-5c5a-315b-be3b-329bd3378c60\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/359e9bfd-d04d-3ee5-931a-c69b04eac8d2","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"United States","importance":"1","originalValue":"United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/60ca069d-5c5a-315b-be3b-329bd3378c60\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/60ca069d-5c5a-315b-be3b-329bd3378c60\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/d4e7aeef-a522-3540-b10e-11291a906cef","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Geography of Texas","importance":"1","originalValue":"Geography of Texas"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/60ca069d-5c5a-315b-be3b-329bd3378c60\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/60ca069d-5c5a-315b-be3b-329bd3378c60\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/b6b73331-5df7-30b5-a160-d319d4ac2ed7","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"International Republican Institute","importance":"2","originalValue":"International Republican Institute"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/60ca069d-5c5a-315b-be3b-329bd3378c60\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/60ca069d-5c5a-315b-be3b-329bd3378c60\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/7d63454d-17bd-3fa2-8dde-0d34d820b9a7","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"John McCain","importance":"2","originalValue":"John McCain"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/60ca069d-5c5a-315b-be3b-329bd3378c60\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/60ca069d-5c5a-315b-be3b-329bd3378c60\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/f0a138fd-5a24-3703-a864-e01c476f4239","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Dallas","importance":"2","originalValue":"Dallas"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/60ca069d-5c5a-315b-be3b-329bd3378c60\/SocialTag\/7":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/60ca069d-5c5a-315b-be3b-329bd3378c60\/SocialTag\/7","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/adfcff3a-7ef9-3edc-8c5d-4b8a840d9acb","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Robert E.
