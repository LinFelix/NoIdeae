Interventions included the provision of refreshments, medical consultations and the distribution of core relief items. The majority of refugees and migrants disembarked were men (91.2%). Women and children represented 6.8% and 2% respectively. Since the beginning of the month, the following nationalities were the highest amongst individuals disembarked in Libya: Sudanese (322 - 27%); Moroccan (86 individuals - 7%), Cameroonian (71 individual - 6%), Malian (70 individuals - 6%), Bangladeshi (62 individuals - 5%), Gambian (60 individuals - 5%), and Nigerian (32 individuals - 3%). Syrian, Eritrean and Ethiopian nationals were also among those rescued\/intercepted at sea this month. This is in line with recent trends of increased number of West African nationals traveling through Libya to cross the Mediterranean.\n\nUNHCR Response\n\nFollowing UNHCR's advocacy efforts, 18 refugees were released from detention facilities in western Libya. The released refugees were referred to the Community Development Centres (CDC) in Tripoli for registration and further assistance, such as primary health care, counselling and material assistance in the form of core relief items (CRIs), hygiene kits and cash assistance. Since January 2016, 972 refugees were released from detention following UNHCR's interventions, 394 in 2017 alone.\n\nUNHCR and UNICEF signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to support the delivery of humanitarian assistance to vulnerable refugees and IDP children in Libya. The MOU reinforces existing cooperation between the two UN agencies. UNHCR's interventions in support of children of concern includes, among others, the provision of UNHCR-issued documentation; facilitating free access to education; identifying children with special needs; and providing specialized assistance. As an example of UNHCR's child protection interventions, on 16 August, UNHCR and its NGO partner CESVI organized recreational activities for refugee children at the Social Centre in Tripoli, with over 190 participants attending. In addition, on 21 August, UNHCR commenced the distribution of 1,500 school bags in its two CDCs in Tripoli. These school bags provide refugee children with essential materials for the new school year.\n\nUNHCR and Handicap International signed a partnership agreement to support Libyan IDPs and returnees suffering from disabilities, injuries or other specific needs. Under this agreement, they will receive specialized services such as psychosocial support and physical therapy. Outreach teams will ensure that individuals requiring home-based support will receive physical therapy or assistive devices. Support and advice will also be provided to caregivers on how to care for persons with disabilities and persons with injuries more effectively.\n\nEfforts to ensure solutions for persons of concern in Libya continue, with the departure of a refugee family to Denmark under a private sponsorship arrangement on 17 August. So far in 2017, 19 refugees departed from Libya under UNHCR's resettlement program, including 13 vulnerable women survivors of violence previously held in captivity.\n\nHumanitarian access\n\nNext week, UNHCR and LibAid will commence a distribution of 2,500 CRI kits to IDP and returnee families in and around Benghazi, providing sleeping mats, kitchen sets, blankets, hygiene kits and plastic sheets. This will be the first CRI distribution in the city since LibAid and UNHCR signed a partnership agreement on 27 July 2017.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
