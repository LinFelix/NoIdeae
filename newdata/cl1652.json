The data is valuable for serving personalized advertisements to Internet users. But the bill was shelved before reaching a final vote.\n\nThe bill would have essentially replicated federal rules that were blocked by the Republican-controlled Congress and President Trump before they could be implemented. The bill would have prohibited ISPs from refusing to serve, or limiting service to, customers who don't opt into data sharing. The bill also would have prohibited ISPs from charging customers more if they refuse to waive their privacy rights.\n\n\"But despite the appeal of resisting Trump -- a favorite topic for lawmakers -- the bill never saw action,\" The Mercury News reported.\n\nThe California legislature is controlled by Democrats, who generally support the opt-in privacy requirements. But the legislature \"kowtowed to an aggressive lobbying campaign, from telecommunications corporations and Internet companies, which included spurious claims and false social media advertisements about cybersecurity,\" the EFF said.\n\nInternet providers, advertisers, and tech companies had urged California state senators to vote against the proposed law earlier this week.\n\nThe legislation is stalled for the rest of this year, but could be proposed again in 2018, the EFF said. Privacy protections could also be the subject of a ballot question. \"A ballot initiative\n\nproposed this month would give California consumers the right to know what personal information businesses are collecting, what they do with it and to whom they are selling it,\" the Los Angeles Times wrote.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
