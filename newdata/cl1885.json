The show has really stayed much longer in our collective memory than its duration on air would lead you to believe - just one season, from 1962-63. Time Magazine called the show \"silly and unpretentious, corny and clever, now and then quite funny\" when discussing the upcoming 1962 TV season. In the article, more was made of the Jetsons being derivative of the Flintstones, and copying their robotic maid after Hazel, a show I had long forgotten.\n\nOf course, the show lingers because it offers a futuristic view - we all want to drive flying cars! It takes place 100 years in the future, but in some ways we're already there. I was doing some \"research\" and watched a couple of episodes. There were flat screen TVs and video conferencing. The treadmills were for walking dogs, while many of us use them today for exercise in our homes (or for holding laundry, which my elliptical does a fair amount of). The pain of George Jetson's \"button-pushing finger\" is not far off from carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nOther \"predictions\" from the show I don't see happening, such as George complaining about working for three hours. While automating production might allow for fewer hours worked, I doubt anyone will get a full-time salary for it. Food preparation is much more in the eye of the beholder here. There are plenty of people who would love to just push a button and get a meal, but many of us enjoy cooking. I think it speaks more to the reality of 1962, when housework was much more arduous. Roombas are now available, and I know of no one who attacks house cleaning with the same kind of passion as foodies attack a special meal. Although a case could be made for de-cluttering, as the audience we had with our recent program here at the Cordelia Library will attest to.\n\nAll of this evolves around artificial intelligence (AI), which has been in the news quite a bit lately. Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri and Google Assistant all answer simple questions now. Self-driving cars are on the horizon and could take my kids to school - if I fully trusted them. Will the future with AI be for better or worse - or most likely, both? Famed tech CEO Elon Musk called AI \" . . . a fundamental existential risk for human civilization\" at the National Governors Association this summer. And Stephen Hawking called AI \"a bigger threat than climate change.\"\n\nThe beauty of predicting 100 years in the future is that no one expects to be around to be proven wrong. Popular Mechanics had a list from 2012 that seems pretty reasonable, including using AI for many nursing positions as the number of people over the age of 60 will outnumber the people under the age of 15 worldwide by 2045. The BBC thought in 2012 that we would all have computerized parts in the future. And this summer a Wisconsin company offered to implant chips in their employees as a way to pay for snacks in the break room, among other functions. Samsung's future focuses on cities, and predicts skyscrapers going both up and down, 25 floors underground. This is something I had heard 20 years ago when I lived in Seoul, a city where land is already at a premium.\n\nNone of these predictions is truly pioneering, forcing us to live and think in a completely different way. They are more an intensification of what is already available or imminent. I have to admit that my own thoughts for the future are not completely revolutionary, but a continuation on the path we're already on as well. I see the ability to cloister ourselves away from the rest of society continuing to rise, but I also think most people will continue to look for opportunities to spend time with one another. I see this in the knitting groups and book clubs that libraries currently provide. It would be just as easy to knit or read in the comfort of your own home - easier in fact. But being a social species is in our DNA, and no improvement in technology is going to change that.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
