Russia denies Western accusations it fomented the conflict and provided arms and fighters.\nThe observers are there to monitor implementation of a peace deal agreed in Minsk in 2015, which has been largely unsuccessful in settling the conflict despite German and French urgings.\nSome German politicians have said sanctions should be lifted if the peace deal is implemented. Christian Lindner, leader of the Free Democrats, a likely coalition partner for Merkel after Sept. 24 elections, even suggested Germany must accept Russia's occupation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula.\nMerkel said Putin's proposals were \"tender shoots\" of progress, \"which give no cause for softening sanctions\" so far. She rejected Lindner's proposal.\n\"The annexation is against international law and must not be accepted,\" she said.\n\n (Reporting By Thomas Escritt; editing by Ralph Boulton)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
