Longmont Community Foundation is hoping to make the anniversary of the 2013 flood a catalyst for yearly donations to local nonprofit organizations.\n\nLast year, the nonprofit umbrella organization encouraged residents to perform acts of kindness surrounding the Sept. 11 anniversary of the flood that ravaged areas around the St. Vrain River in Boulder County.\n\nThis year, Longmont Community Foundation Executive Director Eric Hozempa said they are encouraging people to give to 23 community projects during the month of September, and especially on Sept. 26, which they have designated Longmont Live and Give Day.\n\n\"We decided to try to raise some money for some great projects in need and we wanted to start small and not have hundreds of projects on our website,\" he said. \"So we have a small group of 23 projects and we're looking to collectively have the community support these ventures.\"\n\nWhile the Longmont Community Foundation is positioning Sept. 26 as a kind of hyperlocal donation drive day similar to the statewide Colorado Gives Day, Hozempa stressed that people can donate to the projects or the general fund at any time during the year.\n\n\"We want to see how much we can raise in that 24 hours (on Sept. 26),\" he said. \"We decided to do it small and locally and see if it builds and grows and we think it can.\"\n\nHozempa said that he hopes that Live and Give Longmont Day will grow in future years.\n\n\"Part of that will be trying to get the business community and other community leaders to get involved and help these nonprofit groups raise money,\" Hozempa said.\n\nThe 23 projects that are a part of Live and Give Longmont Day are:\n\n* $5,000 for the Hispanic Education Foundation Returning Scholarship Program, which would allow local Hispanic students to continue their higher education\n\n* $45,000 for The Micah Project, which would build six affordable housing units for 14 low-income, elderly or disabled people\n\n* $10,000 for Discovery Days, a drop-in arts and crafts program for small children at the Longmont Museum and Cultural Center\n\n* $13,200 for the Inn Between, which provides a safe, stable home as well as case management and life skills training for people facing homelessness\n\n* $7,000 for the St. Vrain Historical Society to continue to preserve the Historic Hoverhome at 1309 Hover St.\n\n* $10,000 for Imagine! to fund entrance fees to local events for adults with developmental disabilities\n\n* $7,667 for Crossroads School's remediation program, which provides annual one-on-one assessments for at-risk students\n\n* $5,000 for the Skyline High School Education Foundation to cover Advanced Placement exam fees for students\n\n* $10,000 to upgrade the sound system for the Longmont Theatre\n\n* $17,000 for Longmont Meals on Wheels, which helps elderly and disabled people in the community with nutrition and social interaction\n\n* $5,000 for The Sunshine Club, which provides emergency dental care to local seniors and children in need\n\n* $5,500 for The Art of Possibilities, which offers developmentally disabled people access to art\n\n* $5,000 for the Safe Shelter of the St. Vrain Valley's White Ribbon Campaign, which works to end domestic violence\n\n* $5,000 for Artist Express Arts Longmont, which provides stipends to bring art professionals into local classrooms\n\n* $8,000 to replace both ovens in the Longmont Senior Center commercial kitchen to better serve seniors who use the Longmont Meals on Wheels program\n\n* $10,000 for A Woman's Work to help 10 women and their families with emergency needs such as child care and transportation\n\n* $6,700 for Intercambio to provide home English classes to 27 immigrants\n\n* $2,000 for Habitat for Humanity of the St. Vrain Valley, which works to shelter families in Longmont, Lyons and the Carbon Valley\n\n* $15,000 for the OUR Center to provide basic needs for low-income people, such as rent and utility assistance\n\n* $10,000 for the Longmont Community Justice Partnership to continue to practice restorative justice\n\n* $10,000 for the city to purchase furniture and program supplies to repurpose the old Lashley Street Fire Station into a space for older adults and youth\n\n* $15,000 for the Aspen Center for Child Development to provide scholarships for low-income families\n\n* $12,500 for HOPE to help 45 people who are homeless have a safe place to heal after a medical emergency","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
