(Source: AP) VIDEO: First-in-line for Apple iPhone 8, this man camped 2 days outside storeThis mom freaked out after spotting a MOUSE in the HOUSE, but the twist will leave you LOL-ing'Kohli, Marry Me!': A Pakistani policeman's placard for Virat Kohli is breaking the Internet\n\nThe ever-vigilant Twitterati never miss any action of the US President, Donald Trump, and today was no different. The POTUS along with his wife Melania Trump were at Joint Base Andrews, where they met military families for an airshow demonstration. At the event, the FLOTUS introduced her husband and invited him on stage to deliver his speech. But, something weird happened after that and it grabbed everyone's attention.\n\nIn a footage that is going viral, after the FLOTUS called Trump on stage, he came and thanked her and put his hand forward to exchange a handshake! That's not a greeting people are used to seeing between a couple, is it? Had it been the likes of Obamas, they wouldn't have shaken hands with their spouse.\n\nSoon, the video, shared by journalist Caitriona Perry went viral, with Tweeple going berserk over the tweet, calling it \"awkward\", and even trying to recreate the scene with their pets!\n\nWatch the video here.\n\nThe US First Lady introduces her husband on stage at an event at Joint Base Andrews.

I can't imagine having ever been that desperate for a green card.\n\n-- Norah Jane (@NorahJane10) September 16, 2017\n\nWow.

Nothing like a strong hand shake with your wife.\n\n-- JeffGWillResist (@sbbytor) September 15, 2017\n\nShe hates him more than anyone else because she's seen him at close range & is sickened by him.\n\n-- Rick McConnell (@alaskier) September 15, 2017\n\nAnd then he pushes her off the stage...\n\n-- Gracie St. Ives (@roguecats7) September 16, 2017\n\nBut this is not the first time Netizens noticed something as awkward as this. Earlier this year, when the couple was in Isreal on a state visit, Melania Trump had swat away her husband's hand at the airport and people couldn't ignore it. After all, the president has a history with awkward handshakes -- from his greetings with Japanese PM to Polish First Lady refusing handshake with Trump -- and we have seen it all.\n\nFor all the
