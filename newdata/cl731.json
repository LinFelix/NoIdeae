They said: 'You have one minute to get out of the house and get away.' I just got out, I got my three children and we left the house and the street.\"\n\nInvestigators - who it is understood are linking the attack to Islamist extremism - are continuing their probe and the threat level remains at critical, which means a further attack is feared to be imminent.\n\nThe country's top counter-terrorism officer indicated that a potential network of plotters could have been involved.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said police were \"chasing down suspects\".\n\nPolice declined to say where the 18-year-old detained man was from, whether he was the suspected bomber or the precise details of the offence for which he was arrested.\n\nHis capture took place in the port area of Dover at around 7.50am, which is the busiest ferry hub in Europe and serves as a commercial gateway to the French coast, including Calais and Dunkirk.\n\nA key strand of the investigation has focused on CCTV as officers comb through footage to establish who planted the device, and when and where it was placed on the train.\n\nSecurity minister Ben Wallace suggested CCTV images of the bomber could be released as part of the hunt for those responsible, but Scotland Yard subsequently denied there were any plans to do so.\n\nThe vast manhunt was launched after an improvised device partially exploded on a District Line train at Parsons Green station during the Friday morning rush hour, injuring 30. Three victims remain in hospital, NHS England said.\n\nTroops have been dispatched to free up armed police officers after the country's terror threat level was raised to its highest point.\n\nFriday's device reportedly contained the explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and nails, but is thought to have only partially detonated from inside a bucket.\n\nParsons Green station was reopened in the early hours of Saturday.\n\nThere were fears the number of those hurt could have been much higher - with the real potential for life-threatening injuries - had the bomb, which was concealed within a supermarket carrier bag, fully exploded.\n\nIt is not yet known whether the device, which was reportedly fixed with a timer, went off at its intended target.\n\nThe train - bound for Edgware Road - was just pulling into the station in south-west London when the device detonated in the rear carriage, sending passengers fleeing to safety.\n\nCopyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2017, All Rights
