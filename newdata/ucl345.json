Along with T-Mobile, they are\noffering deals for the newest iPhones that are less generous\nthan in the past.\nWall Street largely shrugged off reports showing an\nunexpected drop in U.S. retail sales last month and the first\ndrop in industrial output since January, both in part due to the\nimpact of Hurricane Harvey.\n\"Investors are keeping an eye on the retail sales data,\nthinking it may be transitory, and are focusing on growth areas\nsuch as technology, which is mostly immune to policy decisions\nin D.C. and has avoided all the global noise,\" said Michael\nAntonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at\nRobert W. Baird in Milwaukee.\nU.S. stocks have surged this year, despite turmoil in the\nWhite House, doubts about President Donald Trump's ability to\npush through his pro-business reforms, uncertainty over the\ntiming of interest rate hikes, and lately, tensions over\nPyongyang's missile tests.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.29 percent to\nend at 22,268.34 points, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.18\npercent to 2,500.23, records for both.\nThe Nasdaq Composite added 0.3 percent to 6,448.47.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a\n1.76-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.47-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nEarlier, North Korea fired a second missile in as many weeks\nover Japan, drawing criticism from global leaders but barely\nmoving shares as investors await the next catalyst - the Federal\nReserve's meeting on Sept. 19-20.\nThe S&amp;P 500 is trading near 17.6 times expected earnings,\ndown from 17.9 at the end of July but still much higher than its\n10-year average of 14.3, according to Thomson Reuters\nDatastream.\nBoeing rose 1.53 percent to a record high after\nCanaccord Genuity raised its price target for the stock.\nAmong the laggards was Oracle, which sank 7.67\npercent, its worst day in more than four years after\ndisappointing forecasts for its profit and cloud business.\nAbout 8.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges,\nabove the 20-day average of 5.9 billion shares.\n(Additional reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing\nby Nick Zieminski and Jonathan Oatis)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
