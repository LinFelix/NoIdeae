Picture: Luka Kauzlaric\n\nView More Local BusinessList Your Business Here\n\nA SPORTING club targeted three times in thefts for a life-saving device has now been gifted the tool, so it can focus more on the field.\n\nWe hope we never have to use it, but honestly, it's a case of life and death. - Mount Clear president Anthony Tigchelaar\n\nSt John Ambulance Victoria has delivered Mount Clear Cricket Club a defibrillator ahead of the summer season, after learning the device and replacements had been stolen in three thefts the past three years.\n\nA defibrillator is not a requirement for Ballarat cricket, as it is in football, but most clubs regard it as essential.\n\nMounties president Anthony Tigchelaar said the club had been exploring grants processes when St John Ambulance made the gesture.\n\n\"We hope we never have to use it, but honestly, it's a case of life and death,\" Mr Tigchelaar said.\n\n\"This is something we keep here all year...We're extremely grateful St John came along so the whole community, everyone who uses the recreation reserve, can have the benefit of being available.\"\n\nMr Tigchelaar said the cricket club had obtained a replacement defibrillator via a St John grant about 15 months ago and had not expected extra financial support this time around.\n\nHe said the club had been sounding out St John help for how to best price and source another replacement when the club instead received the kind gesture.\n\nSt John Ambulance Victoria regional account executive Peter Gunn said the ambulance service deemed defibrillators should be a standard piece of medical equipment at all sporting clubs in case of a cardiac emergency among players or supporters.\n\nIf a defibrillator is accessible in a cardiac emergency, the survival rate is 70 per cent.\n\n\"At St John we acknowledge, it can be difficult to raise the funds to purchase a defibrillator for a sports club so when we heard the news that this local club had their Defibrillator stolen for the third time we really wanted to help,\" Mr Gunn said.\n\nSt John Ambulance has been providing first aid services for more than 130 year. Part of the not-for-profit organisation's mission is to reduce preventable deaths and increasing defibrillators across the community.\n\nThe device at Mount Clear will be accessible for all pavillion users, including Mount Clear junior football and netball, and Mount Clear College.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
