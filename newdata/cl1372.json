As the city burned, Greek soldiers were evacuated by boat, leaving over two hundred thousand Greeks and Armenians totally unprotected. Turkish forces continued to ravage the city, proceeding to loot businesses, and rape and kill hundreds of thousands more defenceless civilians.\n\nHistorical accounts reveal over 100,000 people were slaughtered, 160,000 were driven to other parts of Turkey, and more than 50,000 houses, 24 churches, and 28 schools, banks, consulates, and hospitals were burned.\n\nThe Catastrophe of Asia Minor is widely remembered as one of the worst humanitarian crises of the 20th century. Interestingly, the Catastrophe of Smyrna also features one the most remarkable interventions in human history by one of the most unremarkable men of his time.\n\nAsa Jennings, a methodist pastor from upstate New York, defined by his diminutive stature and shy personality is responsible for saving up to a quarter million people from imminent slaughter, after arriving in Smyrna after the Turkish invasion.\n\nChristian author, speaker, and social activist Dave Andrews says the tremendous humanitarian role Asa Jennings played in the rescuing of over 1 million refugees is one that needs to be heard, especially at a time of global humanitarian disaster.\n\n\"It's a really important story, particularly at a time like now, where people are fleeing Myanmar and there are people caught between allied forces and Isis, and of course you've got the east Africa catastrophe, as well,\" Mr Andrews said.\n\nWhen the great fire broke out in Smyrna, thousands of fleeing refugees rushed to Quai, hoping to be evacuated by the American and British naval ships. But the American and British naval boats had orders only to evacuate American and British personnel. It was there Asa committed to saving the lives of 350,000 Greek and Armenian refugees, who were stranded on the shores of Quai.\n\nJennings travelled through the burnt ruins of Smyrna to the Turkish Army camp, to plead for a meeting with 'legend among the Turks,' Mustafa Kemal. Asa's great faith and polite persistence earned him the respect of Kemal, and was permitted to evacuate all the surviving women and children, and men below 17 and over 45.\n\nAfter gaining authorisation from Mustafa Kemal, Jennings approached the Greek prime minister to organise a fleet of naval ships to aid the surviving refugees. Initially, the prime minister refused, insisting that the Turks would capture their ships and use them to invade the Greek Islands.\n\nBut again, Asa's pragmatic and persistent nature worked in his favour, as the prime minister appointed him admiral of the Greek navy and was given full control of the entire naval fleet.\n\nOver the coming weeks, Jennings sailed between Smyrna and Mytilene and rescued over 350,000 stranded refugees from 'almost certain death'. By December, he had rescued over 500,000.\n\nAccording to The Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, 1,250,000 people in total were rescued as part of the mass humanitarian intervention conducted by Asa Jennings.\n\nDave Andrews believes that the story of Asa Jennings is not only inspiring, but universally relevant, as he was an ordinary figure who strived to improve the lives of others through selfless humanitarian action.\n\n\"Humanity needs to be challenged with the need to find the courage to act in the face of crisis. The central task of a human being is to minimise the damage of anything negative, so stories like this inspire ordinary everyday people,\" he says.\n\n\"Asa was just an ordinary everyday guy and he's definitely someone who can inspire ordinary people to try and make change with what you have.\"\n\nThe Asia Minor Greek Historical Society invites all Greek Associations to lay a wreath in memory of those fallen.\n\nAt the end of the service, attendees will move outside for a Trisagion (Memorial) Service, followed by the placement of wreaths.\n\nMorning tea will then follow in the Welfare Room in the Administration Building of the Greek Community of St. George.\n\nEvent details\n\nTime: Sunday 17th September at 9.00am,\n\nVenue: The Devine Liturgy (in Greek) will be celebrated at the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, Edmonstone St. South Brisbane.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
