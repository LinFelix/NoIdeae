Let us know what's going on!\n\nDavid Green\n\nDavid Green, 77, of Fitzwilliam died on Friday, Sept. 15, 2017. He passed peacefully at home after a period of declining health.\n\nHe was born in Reading, England, on Jan. 7, 1940, to Arthur and Dorothy (Middleton) Green and spent his childhood in post-war Britain. He won a scholarship to attend the prestigious Reading School, leaving at 16 to join the National Provincial Bank to help support the family. He began his involvement in social activism, volunteering for Oxfam, campaigning for nuclear disarmament and the boycott of South African goods. This led to a leave of absence from the bank to work in refugee\/displaced persons camps in Austria, relief work in Egypt and then to Israel. He fell in love with Israel and Kibbutz Kabri in the Western Galilee. He became a member, working for seven years in the banana plantation of the Kibbutz.\n\nDavid and Barbara met at Kabri, and they married in the U.S. in 1973. David received his Bachelor of Science from UMass Amherst in physics in 1974, Master of Science in biophysics in 1976 and Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1979, and then completed a post-doctoral fellowship at Harvard Medical School. His scientific career included research biochemist at New England Nuclear, research manager at E.I. DuPont de Nemours, where he was involved in developing bioresearch and clinical diagnostic kits, and technical director of Cellmark Diagnostics, tasked with introducing new DNA technology into the U.S., often providing expert witness testimony in high-profile legal cases involving DNA fingerprinting. He later founded BioMolecular Assays, Inc. as a service business to the biotechnology sectors of the health care industry.\n\nAfter retiring, David continued with his involvement in scientific research. In addition, he was active on a variety of boards and committees, including as treasurer and later president of Congregation Ahavas Achim in Keene. His interest in preserving the rural beauty of Fitzwilliam led to a project with a like-minded partner to put land into easement and that led to the establishment of Tracie's Community Farm in Fitzwilliam.\n\nHe had a lifelong passion for gardening and enjoyed transforming the landscape of every place they lived. He greatly enjoyed time with his grandchildren, reading and crossword puzzles.\n\nDavid is survived by his wife, Barbara; son, Amit Green and his wife, Sharon, of Pelham; daughter, Kerry Shrives and her husband, Richard, of Harvard, Mass.; two grandchildren, Daniel and Rachel; and a large extended family.\n\nA funeral will be held on Monday, Sept. 18, at noon at Congregation Ahavas Achim, 84 Hastings Ave., Keene. Burial will follow at Monadnock View Cemetery, Park Avenue, Keene.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in his memory may be made to Congregation Ahavas Achim or The Monadnock Conservancy.\n\nCheshire Family Funeral Chapel of Keene is in charge of arrangements.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
