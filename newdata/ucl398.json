That is up from the previous week's price of 300.91\nyuan, or $46.15 based on the corresponding exchange rate.\nThe ministry did not respond to an email seeking additional\ndetails.\n\"Nobody is changing contracts for now,\" said one oil trader\nconsulted about the issue who asked not to be identified.\n\"Oil is a commodity that is traded almost exclusive in\ndollars. PDVSA's debts, for example, are still denominated in\ndollars ... and that's how they'll have to pay bondholders,\" the\ntrader said, referring to the state oil company.\nVenezuela's Dicom currency system on Wednesday temporarily\nsuspended the sale of dollars in order to incorporate other\ncurrencies.\nLate socialist leader Hugo Chavez during his 14-year rule\nrepeatedly vowed to back away from the dollar, which he said was\nbeing printed indiscriminately and was destined to lose its\nplace as the world's dominant currency.\nBut Venezuela remains dependent on the greenback given that\nit conducts ample commercial trade with the United States both\nthrough exports of oil and imports of U.S. food and consumer\nproducts.\nSanctions by the administration of President Donald Trump\nblocked U.S. citizens from buying new debt from Venezuela or its\nstate oil company, but did not directly interrupt import and\nexport operations.\n(Reporting by Eyanir Chinea and Brian Ellsworth;
