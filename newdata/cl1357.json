There was a point in my life that I travelled to Ghana in search of greener pastures but I ended up trekking and sleeping on the streets. I decided to come back to Nigeria.\n\nThen I released 'Alubarika' and 'Girlie O.' Both songs were a hit and in no time, I was invited to perform in Ghana, Kumasi Stadium to be precise. When they came to pick me, I counted the number of cars and it was 13. I was very surprised but was grateful to God,\"\n\nSpeaking on Mr. Eazi's comment that Ghanian music was influencing Nigerian sounds, Patoranking said;\n\n\"We have been having this cultural exchange with Ghana way back since the time Tuface sang 'My love' which featured VIP from Ghana.\n\nTic Tac and Tony Tetuila sang 'Fefe ne efe.' The musical cultural exchange between Nigeria and Ghana has been going on even before I finished secondary school. It is false for Mr. Eazi to say he started that style of music because he did not help me sing my hit song, 'My Woman.' I did it myself and the song is a global hit song. It is the biggest afrobeat song in the Caribbean. I do not agree with his statement. It is wrong.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
