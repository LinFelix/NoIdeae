He also picked up 42 wickets with his off-spin.\n\"After long and careful deliberation, I have decided to retire from first-class and test match cricket with immediate effect,\" Duminy, who opted out of the opening round of domestic first-class fixtures in South Africa, said in a statement.\n\"It is an experience that cannot be replaced and one I will always cherish. Test cricket has always been the pinnacle and I've been fortunate enough to experience some memorable highlights with the Proteas and also in first-class matches with the WSB Cape Cobras.\"\nDuminy made his test debut with an unbeaten half-century at Perth against Australia in 2008 to help South Africa hunt down a target of 414, the second-highest successful run-chase in test cricket.\n\"In the years ahead, my focus will be placed on attaining limited-overs cricket success for South Africa and the WSB Cape Cobras...\" he added.\nSouth Africa's next test assignment is a two-match home series against Bangladesh from Sept. 28.
