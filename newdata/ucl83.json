There are also about 100 wounded.\"\nA Western diplomat said at least 18 refugees died and dozens more were wounded.\nA local army spokesman, Dieudonne Kasereka, told Reuters there had been clashes between soldiers and refugees armed with knives and machetes, but that he did not know if there were any deaths.\nMore than 400,000 refugees have fled Congo's neighbor Burundi since violence erupted there in April 2015 when President Pierre Nkurunziza said he would seek a third term in office, a move his opponents said was unconstitutional.\n\n (Reporting By Patient Ligodi and Aaron Ross; Editing
