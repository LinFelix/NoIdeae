They are stretching\nthe limits of democracy.\"\nCatalonia's president Carles Puigdemont, who faces criminal\ncharges for organising the referendum, says he has over 6,000\nballot boxes ready to deploy next month, but their whereabouts\nare a secret.\nToni Castejon, spokesman for the Catalan police force union,\nsaid it was like finding a needle in a haystack.\n\"Right now, we have no idea where they are,\" he said.\nA spokesman for the Catalan regional government declined to\nsay where the ballot boxes were or how the government was going\nto get them out of hiding to voting stations on Oct. 1.\nAt the offices of Catalan newspaper El Vallenc in Valls,\nsome 50 km west of Barcelona, six armed police knocked on the\ndoor last Saturday with a warrant to search the offices, said\nits editor, Francesc Fabregas.\nThe search lasted five-and-a-half hours.\n\"They didn't say what they were looking for,\" Fabregas told\nReuters, adding that he had not printed any voting papers.\nThe raid led to an impromptu crowd gathering outside the\nbuilding, with people singing the Catalan anthem and waving\nslips of paper chanting 'Where are the ballot papers?'.\n\"When people saw that the streets had been cut off they\nstarted coming over with banners, they handed out roses to the\npolice - the street turned into a party,\" said Fabregas.\n\nMARKET JITTERS\nFor some supporters of the independence movement, the search\nfor the ballot boxes and voting papers has become a symbol of\nwhat they see as state repression.\nImages of the Catalan police force - the Mossos d'Esquadra -\nseizing what for many are symbols of democracy would be highly\ninflammatory, police say.\nThe Mossos report to the Catalan regional government and are\nhighly regarded by Catalans, particularly after their handling\nof the Islamist militant attacks in the region in August that\nkilled 16.\nBut Spanish state prosecutors have ordered all police -\nincluding the Catalan force - to act.\n\"What no one wants is the image of the Mossos taking away\nthe ballot boxes,\" said Castejon of the police union. \"That\nwould lead to a lot of anger and even civil unrest.\"\nMadrid has the constitutional power to take over a regional\ngovernment or send in the police to force Catalonia to drop the\nvote, but either step would rock Spain's decentralised model of\ngovernment where power is devolved to 17 self-governed regions.\nAlthough polls show less than half of Catalonia's 5.5\nmillion voters want self-rule, most in the wealthy northeastern\nregion want the chance to vote on the issue, causing unease that\nis beginning to be felt in financial markets.\nThe Budget Ministry said that uncertainty created by the\nstand-off could damage the economy and push up sovereign\nborrowing costs. Some investors sold Spanish government bonds\nand switched to Italian debt earlier this week.\nPuigdemont and Barcelona mayor Ada Colau on Friday appealed\nto the Spanish government for dialogue to avert a crisis.\nBut Puigdemont has shown no signs of backing down.\n\"Does anyone think we're not going to vote? What kind of\npeople do they take us for?\" he said to cheering crowds from a\nstage in a bull-ring in Tarragona to launch the referendum\ncampaign on Thursday.\n(Additional reporting by Dhara
