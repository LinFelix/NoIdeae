We will ask the court if they can do anything bearing that in mind.\"\n\nMs Wisbey said it had taken some time for the club's records to be brought up to date following her appointment in March.\n\n\"The club is run by volunteers, but there are a certain amount of paid staff,\" she said.\n\n\"We now have a pensions scheme in place and they are arranging a bloom payment so no one is going to be left out of pocket.\"\n\nFollowing an initial £400 fine, TPR issued Norfolk Snowsports Club with a £2,500-a-day escalating penalty notice - the level assigned to \"medium-sized\" employers with 50 to 249 employees - for continued non-compliance.\n\nIt was among 51 companies which were subject to a court order by the regulator between April 1 and June 30. A spokesman for TPR said the club had fallen into this category because of the number of people on its pay roll.\n\nHe said: \"We tell people long in advance first to become compliant, then in advance of a fine being issued, and the level of fine they could get if they do not become compliant.\"\n\nHe added that a case would have to \"go a long way down the line\" to reach a county court judgement, as the sports club's had.\n\nNicola Parish, executive director for frontline regulation at TPR, said: \"We expect trustees to comply with their basic duties including providing information in the scheme return on time.\"\n\nUnder the Pensions Act 2008 UK employers must put staff aged between 22 and state pension age and earning more than £10,000 a year into a pension scheme and contribute towards it.\n\nNon-compliance with these regulations - known as auto-enrolment - can range from failing to give full contributions or enrol staff on schemes, keeping incorrect or incomplete employee records, or simply not filing the correct paperwork on time.\n\nAn escalating penalty notice is issued if employers continue to be non-compliant with regulations after receiving a £400 fixed penalty notice. These penalties can increase by up to £10,000 a day - depending on the number of employees - until the fee is paid. Employers that remain non-compliant can face additional enforcement action, including county court judgements or prosecution.\n\nThe Pensions Regulator issued 33,716 compliance notices between April 2016 and March 2017.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
