We chased after him and didnât succeed,â Atin said,\n\nKakrao chief Pius Amara said Otieno had a history of threatening to commit suicide each time he was slighted by family members.\n\nHis body was found hanging from a tree by students going to school.\n\nThe body was removed by police and taken to Migori Referral Hospital mortuary.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
