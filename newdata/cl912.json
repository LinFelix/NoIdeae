In the quest of suspects following September 14, 2017, Fossilized human footprints theft news, Hellenic Police, national police service of Greece has arrested a 55-year-old man. Out of 29 visible tracks on Crete, some four or five were stolen on Crete. Precisely, 5.7 million years old as anything because scientists understand just 3.7 million years ago humans started to walk standing dropping behind those footprints. This all people's property was needlessly destroyed at Kasteli site where post-stolen scenes showed footprints were cut away and removed from the rock.\n\nA similar case, which concerned the police investigation was witnessed in the Isle of Skye, connected to Scotland's northwest coast by a bridge in Scotland of dating from around 165m year ago.\n\nMatthew Bennett, Professor of Environment and Geographical Sciences at Bournemouth University while explaining how this devastation could limit the upcoming biopsies and verifications said: \"We are lucky that the whole area has been 3D-scanned with an optical laser scanner in high resolution as part of the original study.\"\n\nProfessor Bennett in The Conversation said pointed out to the money as the major problem. Telling about the previous number of attempts to steal the fossil, Professor Benett said: \"It is expensive to erect and maintain protective structures, and to gain funds you need publicity to ensure that all the stakeholders involved are aware of the scientific, social and emotional value of a site.\"\n\nReportedly, an investigation is still on run by police and scientists. The theft was first reported to the police by a public visitor on Tuesday. Fossilized human footprints News: Greek Police in Kissamos, Western Crete has caught the accused of looting and damaging Fossilised human footprint site in Crete.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
