The hard part is that she has to wait a week or two after school starts to make her first appearance.\n\nAnn, 78, will show up every day at Estes Elementary School in Arden as a volunteer who works with children in reading and math and reads stories to them. Her health is not great, but it is her unofficial job that keeps her going.\n\n\"It is the highlight of my time,\" said Sizemore, who loves the children and loves being a teacher of children, something she has been doing for more than 50 years.\n\n\"When I went in my first classroom as a child, there was a Victrola at the door. There was a little teacher at the door, Beatrice Ponder, who took us under her wing, and I knew the day I walked out of there that's what I wanted to do. And I never changed my mind.\"\n\nAnn came from a family of educators, with two aunts who were teachers and a grandmother who was a teacher at Valley Springs School when it was a one-room school.\n\nShe started teaching right out of college and taught the first year at Marion Elementary School, driving there every day from Spruce Pine, where she was living with her husband, Ed. When Ed was transferred to Waynesville the next year, she got a job at Valley Springs School and taught first and second grades there until she retired in 1992.\n\nAfter she retired, she stayed out a year, a requirement at the time, and then asked Mike Stevenson, then principal at Estes, if he had any openings. That was on a Saturday. She went back to work on Monday as a Title One teaching assistant.\n\n\"I couldn't stay away,\" she said.\n\nBy now, she has taught grandchildren of the very children she went to school with and she has taught three or four generations of some families. Everywhere she goes in the South Buncombe community she sees people who want to share their school days stories with her.\n\nIn addition to her teaching children in the early grades, she coached square dance teams from Valley Springs Schools when many schools in the area had teams that performed at the Mountain Dance and Folk Festival.\n\nEventually, though, Sizemore did retire for good and went back to Estes a couple of days a week as a volunteer. Then she got sick and ended up in a nursing home for three years. When she was well enough to come home, she had two goals in mind: to go back to church and to go back to school.\n\n\"I got to do both,\" she said.\n\nThis will be her fourth year back at Estes, where she dutifully shows up every day and stays for three or four hours, reading to children and working with small groups in reading and math. Estes School feels like home to her, and a constant reminder of that is that the school's library, the Ann W. Sizemore Library, was named for her to honor her devotion to the school and its children.\n\nSizemore plans to keep on keeping on as long as she is able, and her doctors think the contact with the school personnel and the children is good for her health.\n\n\"I thank them for letting me do it,\" she said. \"It's my life saver.\"\n\nThis is the opinion of Carole Currie, whose columns one Sunday a month.
