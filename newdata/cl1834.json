as a wise man once said, you are never more vulnerable than when you have scored a goal and that old pearl came back to haunt Wicklow as they switched off in the moments after Boland's sweet strike and a long searching ball from the superb Jack Goulding was won by Shane Conway and the rest, as plenty of wise people have said over the years, was history.\n\nThe goal was a hammer blow for Wicklow who had been performing so well up to that point and Boland's second goal was out of the top drawer in terms of team effort with captain Pádraig Doyle performing miracles along the sideline before passing inside the Jack Doyle.\n\nDoyle cleverly help up play for an instant before firing a pass to Padraig O'Toole who in turn picked out Seanie Germaine and the Baltinglass man slipped a sweet pass across to Boland and he fired home despite the presence of a tangle of Kerry bodies.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
