Homeland Security oversees the Secret Service, the agency charged with protecting the president.\n\nBut Justice Department officials argued in a letter to CREW released Friday that any records beyond the 22 Japanese names were related to the president's schedule and were therefore exempt from public records laws.\n\n\"The remaining records that the Secret Service has processed in response to the Mar-a-Lago request contain, reflect, or otherwise relate to the President's schedules. The government believes that Presidential schedule information is not subject to\" the Freedom of Information Act, they wrote.\n\nCREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder described the move as \"spitting in the eye of transparency.\"\n\n\"After waiting months for a response to our request for comprehensive visitor logs from the President's multiple visits to Mar-a-Lago and having the government ask for a last minute extension, today we received 22 names from the Japanese Prime Minister's visit to Mar-a-Lago and nothing else. The government does not believe that they need to release any further Mar-a-Lago visitor records. We vehemently disagree,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"The government seriously misrepresented their intentions to both us and the court,\" he said, adding that group would be fighting the decision in court.\n\nThe groups have also been seeking information about visitors to the White House and Trump Tower. DHS has said in response to the lawsuit that it has no records about Trump Tower.\n\nThe White House announced in April that it would not be making public the logs of visitors to the White House complex, breaking with the practice of Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\nThe Obama administration released White House visitor logs beginning in September 2009, after four lawsuits by CREW.\n\nSeeing the names of people who come and go can help the public understand who has the ear of the administration on important policy matters. But senior White House officials cited privacy and national security concerns and said continuing to release the records could interfere with policy development, among other things.\n\nTaxpayers were billed at least $1,092 for stays at Mar-a-Lago, the Washington Post first reported Friday. A receipt in that amount for a two-night stay in March, obtained by the advocacy group Property of the People through a public record request of the U.S. Coast Guard, is another example of how the president stands to profit from the presidency.\n\nDownload the WISH-TV app for your iPhone\/iPad in the App Store Download the WISH-TV app in the Google Play store Like WISH-TV on
