In\nparticular, many lawmakers, including some of Trump's fellow\nRepublicans, worry about his plans to slash the State Department\nbudget to help boost military spending.\nThe Republican-led Senate Appropriations Committee issued a\nblistering report last week accompanying its spending plan for\nState, accusing the Trump administration of pursuing a \"doctrine\nof retreat\" on foreign policy.\nThe presentation was more specific as it listed what State\nand the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) did\nnot intend to do. That list said there is no plan to dismantle\nState and USAID, eliminate the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights\nand Labor, or concentrate power in Tillerson's hands.\nA Senate aide who attended said both Republicans and\nDemocrats seemed frustrated at the lack of specifics.\n\"It was tense in the room at times, with staff from both\nparties asking for specifics and warning the State Department\nofficials that it would be difficult to defend this given the\nlack of specificity and the ongoing problems with early,\nconsistent Congressional consultation on a range of issues,\" the\naide said.\nTillerson wants to eliminate more than 2,000 positions at\nState, out of some 75,000 worldwide. The department's budget is\nabout $51 billion a year.\nAt a news conference this week, Senator Lindsey Graham, the\nRepublican chairman of the subcommittee that oversees State\nDepartment spending, spoke of his opposition to such cuts to\ndiplomacy and foreign aid.\n\"I fear that we're going to get caught blindsided without a\nrobust State Department,\" Graham said, saying that ensuring\nnational security requires soft power as well as a strong\nmilitary.\n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
