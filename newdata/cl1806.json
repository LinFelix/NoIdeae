I'm probably five years old and really enjoying whatever cake batter or cream it was. More than 40 years on and I still lick the whisk, unfortunately.\n\nFood was always very important in our house when I was growing up; Mum was religious about breakfast. We all sat down together for that first meal of the day - even now, Mum always makes an effort to make a big spread.\n\nI get letters from people saying I've changed how they cookYotam Ottolenghi\n\nI was pretty greedy. I really loved eating from a young age. My dad is from Italy and came over to Israel when he was young. I was given the nickname \"Golozo\", which is someone who just wants to eat delicious things and do nothing else. I was really excited about food in the way grown-ups are and children aren't. For me, a great way to celebrate a birthday was to be taken to restaurants.\n\nEven as a child, I had this sense of appreciation of good food. We were quite a middle-class family so we travelled and I got exposed to interesting food throughout my childhood and that shaped my palate.\n\nI was the middle of three children. Jerusalem in the Seventies was a good place to be. It was considered quite safe, in ways it perhaps isn't now. I was outdoors a lot with friends and we wouldn't go home until dinner time.\n\nMy dad was a university professor and my mum was a secondary school teacher. It was an academic household and at some point, perhaps my late teens, I thought I would become an academic too. But I didn't have a passion for one particular subject. I studied philosophy and literature, I was very interested in current affairs and history, and that is still the case today. It seemed likely I would end up becoming a university professor like my dad, but I was never convinced.\n\nWhen I decided to leave my academic career behind both my parents were concerned. I was in my mid-20s and my father wrote me a letter saying, \"If you feel that's what you need to do, do it, but I think you're making a mistake because you've worked so hard to be where you are now.\" It was clear how he felt.\n\nEven the teenage me wouldn't have thought it was a very respectable career to be a chef. At that time it was not a lucrative or admired profession. I probably would have looked at it through my parents' eyes, as a soft career option. But the young me would have been really proud of what I've achieved. When I was doing a course at Le Cordon Bleu school in London in the late Nineties, chatting about one day opening a restaurant, it just seemed like complete fantasy.\n\nI never set out to be a cookery writer or someone people recognise. I'm not entrepreneurial by nature; I'm risk-averse. But my business partners have made it possible. I can hardly believe it when I get letters from people saying I've changed how they cook. It seems like such a lot of power to have in your hands. My younger self would be so proud to know I've had such an effect on what people eat and how they feel. It's pretty amazing.\n\nWhen I was younger I didn't really think I would end up with a family. I thought I'd have a partner but I felt it wasn't really in the realm of possibility for a gay man to have children. Then, at the age of 30, I started putting plans together to have kids, although it took many years to make it happen. My husband Karl and I eventually had our children through surrogacy, and it's wonderful how things have turned out.\n\nI'm 50 next year and the young me would think that is very old. But I still have a lot in common with that little boy licking the whisk. One of my childhood obsessions was prawns, cooked with lemon, garlic and butter. I will never forget that dish. My son Max loves it - and I still love it, too.\n\nSweet by Yotam Ottolenghi and Helen Goh is published by Ebury, £27.
