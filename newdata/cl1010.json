If we keep working together we can achieve great success in the fight again climate change.\"\n\nAn amendment was added to the Montreal Protocol last year by the Kigali Agreement to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, an extremely harmful gas used in refrigerators and air conditioners.\n\n\"Through the reduction of hydrofluorocarbons under the Montreal Protocol, the Earth can avoid warming by up to half a degree Celsius by the end of the century, while we continue to protect the ozone layer,\" McKenna said.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
