It will be after Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, but will award far more delegates than all of those states combined.\n\nThe delegates will be awarded to candidates proportionally, but the winner will be given a flying start and huge momentum.\n\nElection experts believe that winner will then attract most of the money pouring in from Democrat donors, many of whom are based in California, forcing other candidates out of the race.\n\nTraditionally, Democrat White House hopefuls treat California, with its wealthy Hollywood and Silicon Valley donors, as a giant campaign cash machine, but the donors may now favour someone from there.\n\nAnd in what promises to be a very large field that is a huge boost to at least three serious contenders who already have power bases in the state.\n\nChief among them is Kamala Harris, the state's former attorney general, who has been lauded by Democrats during her first term as a US senator in Washington.\n\nShe has been vocal in quizzing members of the Trump administration at Senate hearings and PredictIt, the online political stock market, now rates her chances higher than anybody else, including former Vice President Joe Biden and the 2016 contender Bernie Sanders.\n\nEric Garcetti, the former Mayor of Los Angeles, is also attracting attention.\n\nAnd then there is Jerry Brown, California's current Governor who, ironically, will be the person signing the change of primary date into law.\n\nEnthusiasm for a run by Mr Brown, 79, is growing. It would be his fourth tilt at the White House, having first tried in 1976. In 1992 he came second to Bill Clinton.\n\nDuring a previous stint as Governor of California in the 1970s and 1980s he was known as \"Governor Moonbeam\" because of his enthusiasm for the space programme, and dated the singer Linda Ronsdtat.\n\nOther Californian contenders who could benefit include Tom Steyer, the Democrats' biggest mega-donor in 2016.\n\nThe San Francisco-based hedge fund billionaire and climate-change activist gave nearly $100 million last time. This time he has indicated he may just run himself.\n\nBarack Obama's first speech since stepping down as president 02:16\n\nAnother California-based billionaire, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, has also set tongues wagging.\n\nFor the non-Californian runners moving the primary puts minor candidates at a further disadvantage, with large resources needed to fund criss-crossing of the state, and expensive television adverts.\n\nThat would benefit major players like Mr Sanders, who is likely to try again, and Mr Biden, who seems to regret not running last time.\n\nThe focus on California would also shift the entire Democrat race to the left as candidates woo an electorate much more liberal than in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nMore than half the Hispanic people in the US are in California, and the environment would becomes a key issue in the race, the state having recently suffered an epochal drought.\n\nThe shift to the left is already apparent. Several of the 2020 contenders, including Kamala Harris, have publicly backed a plan launched this week by Mr Sanders for universal government funded healthcare, which Mrs Clinton previously declared too radical.\n\nOther potential 2020 contenders supporting the plan include Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, a high profile critic of Mr Trump,New Jersey senator Cory Booker, and New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand.\n\nOnly one candidate has formally declared already.\n\nJohn Delaney, a US congressman from Maryland, and a self-made businessman worth $215 million, hoped to get a jump on the competiton by announcing his candidacy more than two years before the first primary vote.\n\nHe told the Sunday Telegraph: \"I think am the right person for the job, but not enough people know that. So the way I solve that problem is by getting in early.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
