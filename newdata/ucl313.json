The position of Boeing and\nthe U.S. government is that they are not linked,\" said a second\nsource directly familiar with the matter.\nThe office of Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland,\nwho has overall responsibility for relations with the United\nStates, said it could not confirm the sources' account.\nTime is running out for Canada to end the dispute.\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce is due to hand down its\ninitial ruling on Sept. 26 on whether to impose countervailing\nduties on the CSeries, a decision that could dampen airlines'\ndemand for the 110-130 seat jets in the key U.S. market.\nThat decision could also boost Boeing's leverage in any\nfuture talks with Canada, though the duty would only potentially\napply after a final ruling by the U.S. International Trade\nCommission (ITC) in 2018.\nBombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said on Friday the\ncompany is focused on the 2018 ruling and noted Boeing did not\ntake part in the Delta competition that the CSeries won.\n\"It's really hard to see how they are harmed,\" he said in an\nemail.\nDan Pearson, a former ITC chairman, said it was likely the\nCommerce Department would determine preliminary duties against\nBombardier, giving Boeing leverage in any negotiations.\nBoeing has accused Bombardier of imitating European rival\nAirbus SE by trying to muscle into the U.S. market with\ncut-rate pricing to win a key April 2016 order from Delta Air\nLines Inc.\nThe first source said Canada ideally still wanted to buy the\nF-18s rather than looking for other options.\n\"(Boeing has) put us in a situation where they're forcing us\nto make hard choices ... we can't do business with someone who\nis actually killing our industry,\" said the source.\n(With additional reporting from Tim Hepher in
