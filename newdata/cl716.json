Time and again he's shown he's mastered Twitter.\n\nAfter tweeter-in-chief Donald Trump was elected, Dingell's Twitter game has become even more relevant and fiery.\n\nAfter the violence in Charlottesville and Trump's bumbling mess of a response to the anti-Semitism and white supremacy on display, Dingell took to Twitter in the days following. One particular tweet resonated, with thousands praising the longtime Michigan lawmaker for posting what the president struggled to say.\n\nJust look at those likes.\n\nOnce known as an imposing Democrat with strong opinions and determined to pass universal health care, he's refocused his energy toward the Twittersphere, where he still speaks his mind loud and clear even if it's not on Capitol Hill.\n\nSure, Dingell also spends a lot of his time tweeting about Michigan sports. But after retiring after nearly 60 years in office at the age of 87 (he was the longest-serving member of Congress in history), he's kept a running commentary on the ridiculousness of the government and society in general.\n\nIn the Trump era, where the president uses a micro-blogging platform to announce policy, devise political strategy, and sling insults, Dingell's reactions and responses are a go-to source of humor, insight, and reflection.\n\nDingell's Trump tweets also have bite. Since inauguration day (and throughout the election, too, if you want to look back and laugh-cry) we've been treated to these gems that often encapsulate what a lot of us are thinking.\n\nWhen Trump gave an interview about a missile strike on Syria he talked mostly about \"the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen.\" It was -- weird. Dingell noticed.\n\nDingell joined Twitter in 2010. In the seven-plus years since, he's tweeted almost 5,000 times. Trump, 71, joined about a year earlier, but has racked up nearly 40,000 tweets -- eight times the number of tweets, which seems like a good way to measure Trump's Twitter obsession.\n\nDingell's targets go beyond Trump.\n\nYears before the former reality TV show host joined the political circus, Dingell was posting sharp commentary on, well, everything. The Atlantic called his Twitter feed \"the best\" back in 2014. Some of Dingell's earlier Twitter home runs include a post about Sharknado, excellent usage of the hashtag and term \"YOLO,\" and taking an internet meme to disparage himself.\n\nIn recent days he's brought down Sen. Ted Cruz with his wit. He's plugged in to internet culture, whether it's April the pregnant giraffe or the Kardashians.\n\nWith Dingell's decades of insider knowledge, his posts go beyond your average snarky Trump commentary that poke at the thin-skinned president. Luckily, Dingell hasn't gotten blocked, and maybe he won't if he keeps up with his smartly crafted ripostes.\n\nHis tweets spark discussion, replies, and thousands of retweets and likes.\n\nIf this retired 90-something Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient can keep up with Trump and everything else on Twitter, there's no excuse for the rest of us. Except for the fact that John Dingell has already won Twitter. Maybe the rest of us should just go home.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
