Two adults and 21 teenage students were killed.\n\nMr Singh said that six of the seven boys had tested positive for drugs. Two of the boys had been detained before, one on charges of vehicle theft, another for rioting, he said.\n\nHe gave no details on how the suspects had allegedly been mocked by students at the dormitory.\n\nOfficials said the school was operating without a fire safety permit and licence, and that a dividing wall was illegally built on the top floor that blocked the victims from a second exit.\n\nThe fire renewed calls for better regulation of religious schools.\n\nReligious schools, mostly privately run, are not supervised by the Education Ministry because they come under the purview of state religious authorities. Local media reported there are more than 500 registered tahfiz schools nationwide but many more are believed to be unregistered.\n\nData from the Fire Department showed that 1,083 fires struck religious schools in the past two years, of which 211 were burned to the ground.\n\nThe worst disaster occurred in 1989 when 27 female students at an Islamic school in Kedah state died when fire gutted the school and eight wooden hostels.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
