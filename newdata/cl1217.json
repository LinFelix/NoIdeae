But we need help,\" Arblaster told the council.\n\nYouth sports advocates have campaigned for years to have the fields lighted at night, particularly in the fall and winter months when the sun sets earlier in the day.\n\n\"This is just a huge, huge opportunity for us to bring the light so to speak to the community,\" said Costa Mesa United board member Brett Eckles. \"This is a way to get those 10,000-plus Costa Mesa resident kids on fields throughout the year.\"\n\nOnce agreements with Newport-Mesa are in place, the city will move forward with public outreach efforts before bringing the matter to the Parks and Recreation Commission.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
