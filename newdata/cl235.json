In his injunction, Leinenweber\nfound the city likely to prevail on the merits of its argument\nonce the case is considered in its entirety.\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel hailed Friday's decision at a\nCity Hall news conference as \"an affirmation of the rule of\nlaw.\"\n\"It’s an assertion of our most fundamental American values\nand it’s an unambiguous, clear rejection of the false choice\nthat the Trump Justice Department wanted Chicago to make between\nour values, our principles and our priorities,” Emanuel said.\nA Justice Department spokesman, Devin O'Malley, declined\ncomment when asked whether the administration would appeal the\ncourt order.\nPresident Donald Trump has made tougher immigration\nenforcement a centerpiece of his campaign and presidency, along\nwith a pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border.\nAs part of that policy, the Justice Department has sought to\npunish cities and other local jurisdictions that have joined a\ngrowing \"sanctuary\" movement aimed at shielding illegal\nimmigrants from stepped-up deportation efforts.\nThe Trump administration has argued that its deportation\ncrackdown is focused on illegal immigrants convicted of serious\ncrimes, and that public safety is jeopardized when police refuse\nto notify U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of plans to\nrelease such a person from local custody.\n\"By protecting criminals from immigration enforcement,\ncities and states with 'so-called' sanctuary policies make their\ncommunities less safe and undermine the rule of law,\" O'Malley\nsaid.\nBut critics counter that enlisting police cooperation in\nrounding up immigrants for removal undermines communities' trust\nin local law enforcement, particularly among Latinos, and they\nhave questioned whether the administration is really targeting\ndangerous criminals.\nTrump's opponents also say there is no correlation between\nimmigration and violent crime, citing a sharp drop in homicides\nin Los Angeles since the early 1990s, despite embracing the\nsanctuary cities movement.\nThe grants at issue, under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice\nAssistance Grant, or Byrne JAG, program typically are used to\nhelp police improve crime-fighting techniques, buy new equipment\nand assist victims of crime.\nFederal records show the Justice Department doled out $1\nbillion in Byrne JAG money to state governments, $430 million to\nnonprofits and $136 million directly to cities and counties last\nyear. Chicago is expected to receive $3.2 million this year for\npurchasing equipment.\nDozens of cities have taken a stance on deportation\nenforcement similar to Chicago's including New York, Los\nAngeles, Philadelphia and New Orleans.\nPolice agencies in those jurisdictions have generally barred\ntheir officers from routinely checking individuals' immigration\nstatus when making arrests or traffic stops. And they have\nrefused to keep anyone locked up longer than otherwise warranted\nat the request of federal agents seeking to deport them.\n(Reporting by Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago; Writing;
