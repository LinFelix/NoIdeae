Held at the Jane, in partnership with Cole Haan, the party included, among others, Edward Norton, Julia Stiles , Zosia Mamet, Jenna Lyons, Bridget Everett, Rosie Perez, and Greta Gerwig.\n\nPlanned Parenthood president Cecile Richards, who was one of Lenny's early interviews in 2015, paused briefly on a couch near a sketch artist and personal poetry station (very on brand, Lenny) to reflect on the legacy left by her mother, Ann Richards. The governor of Texas, famous for her wit -- including the gem in which she stated that George Bush \"was born with a silver foot in his mouth\" -- managed to be a powerful Democrat in conservative Texas. But that didn't mean she held her tongue.\n\n\"The older she got, the more radical she got,\" Cecile said. \"I'm beginning to understand that. So even though of course I would love to talk to her and I think about her all the time, I think she would say you've just gotta be militant.\"\n\nRichards, who has spent this year facing promises from the Trump administration to defund Planned Parenthood, remembers the lessons her mother taught her -- namely to stay in the battle.\n\n\"I feel like these mornings I get up and I go, 'I swear to god we just rolled that boulder to the top of the hill, and here it is again.' I think just every morning you gotta get up and fight again.\"\n\nRolling boulders can be paused for a party, though; Friday night's celebrations were lighthearted, as Konner informed attendees that this was \"Lenny's bat mitzvah.\" Dunham thanked her entire team, and upon thanking her C.E.O., Ben Cooley, employed the word \"cock\" in a way she said she was sure would follow her later. \"It wouldn't be a Lenny party if I didn't make a terrible mistake that would haunt me on the Internet,\" she said, apologizing. In response, someone shouted, \"This is a safe space!\"\n\n\"Safe space\" seemed to be the unofficial theme of the night, from the start of the red carpet to the last cocktail. When V.F. caught up with Dunham and Konner early in the evening, they both reiterated Richards's message to stay in the fight -- but with a little self care along the way.\n\n\"I think something that Jenni's really taught me is it's O.K. to shut off,\" Dunham said. \"There are nights when I would be staying up and reading everything and trying to understand everything. But she's like, 'You know what? If you sleep and take care of yourself, it will be there in the morning, and you will be more capable of handling it.'\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
