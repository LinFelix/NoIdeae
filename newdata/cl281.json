Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N.\nSecurity Council have urged Myanmar to end the violence, which\nhe said was best described as ethnic cleansing.\nMyanmar rejects the accusations, saying its security forces\nare carrying out clearance operations to defend against the\ninsurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which claimed\nresponsibility for the Aug. 25 attacks and similar, though\nsmaller, attacks in October.\nRussia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said on Friday\nthat while Moscow was concerned \"we cannot discard the fact that\nit was triggered by terrorist activities.\"\n\"We're talking to the Myanmar government, of course,\" he\ntold reporters. \"We are concerned with what is happening. ... We\nare looking forward to an early cessation of the violence and to\nelevating the humanitarian situation of the population.\"\nThe government has declared Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army a\nterrorist organisation and accused it of setting the fires and\nattacking civilians.\nEthnic cleansing is not recognised as a separate crime under\ninternational law but allegations of ethnic cleansing as part of\nwider, systematic human rights violations have been heard in\ninternational courts.\nRights group Amnesty International said evidence pointed to\na \"mass-scale scorched-earth campaign\" across the north of\nRakhine that was unmistakably ethnic cleansing.\n\"The evidence is irrefutable – the Myanmar security forces\nare setting northern Rakhine state ablaze in a targeted campaign\nto push the Rohingya people out of Myanmar,\" said Tirana Hassan,\nthe group's crisis response director.\nThe group said it had detected 80 big fires in Rohingya\nareas since Aug. 25. While the extent of damage could not be\nverified, due to access restrictions by the government, \"they\nare likely to have burned down whole villages\".\nIt said it also had credible reports of Rohingya militants\nburning the homes of ethnic Rakhine and other minorities. About\n30,000 non-Muslims have also been displaced.\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday\nhe had spoken with Suu Kyi and that she said she was working to\nget aid to areas in Myanmar affected by violence.\nThe generals still control national security policy but\nnevertheless, Suu Kyi has been widely criticised abroad for not\nstopping or condemning the violence. The campaign against the\nMuslim insurgents is popular at home.\nThe U.N. refugee agency said the Rohingya arriving in\nBangladesh were suffering \"real hardship, and some of the most\ndifficult conditions seen in any current refugee situation\".\n\"With the influx increasing daily, UNHCR is appealing for an\ninitial amount of $30 million for the emergency humanitarian\nresponse in Bangladesh until the end of year,\" an agency\nspokesman said in Geneva.\nBangladesh says all refugees must go home and has called for\nsafe areas in Myanmar. Myanmar has ruled that out and says it\nwill accept anyone who can verify their citizenship. Most\nRohingya are stateless.\nThousands of people demonstrated after Friday prayers in the\nBangladeshi capital, Dhaka, to denounce the treatment of the\nRohingya.\nOne protest leader said they were demanding a U.N.\npeacekeeping force and that Myanmar face charges in an\ninternational court.\n(Additional reporting by Danish Siddiqui in COX'S BAZAR,\nSerajul Quadir in DHAKA, Michelle Nichols at
