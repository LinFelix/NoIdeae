It also uses AI to identify and remove what the company deems \"inappropriate content.\"\n\nThe Facebook project will be connected to McGill University's Centre for Intelligent Machines and to the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, started by University of Montreal professor and machine learning pioneer Yoshua Bengio, two sources with knowledge of the plans said.\n\nCombined, University of Montreal and McGill have more than 200 researchers, including students, working on AI research projects, Bengio said. That is up from around 150 cited by Google last year, which it called the greatest academic concentration of AI research in the world.\n\nThe mostly French-speaking province of Quebec boasts around 90 start-up companies focused on artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Canadian federal government has pledged C$125 million to build AI expertise in Montreal, the Toronto-Waterloo corridor, and Edmonton, while the provincial Quebec government has also promised some C$100 million ($82 million) specifically for AI research.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
