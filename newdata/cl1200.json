Without this treatment, the pitches would become unplayable in less than six weeks.\n\nFundraising officer at the club, Chris Collins, and under-9s team manager Chris Aldcroft said: \"Whilst it's great to have our own facilities, the obvious downside is the cost of maintenance and large unexpected outlays such as this which will take us a while to financially recover from.\"\n\nTo help towards the cost the club has set up a Virgin Money Giving page, if you would like to donate you can do so here.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
