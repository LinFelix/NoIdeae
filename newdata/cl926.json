In theory, the stuff will settle into the basin, and as more is pumped in, the dam walls will be raised in steps, 20 feet at a time, over the 20-year life of the mine. Eventually the PolyMet tailings basin will cover 2 1\/2 square miles with 10 million cubic yards of mine waste pumped in each year.\n\nMost of the water will be re-used to keep the slurry system carrying waste rock from the processing plant to the tailings basin. Any water that leaves the basin will be treated by PolyMet with a reverse osmosis filter system (to remove sulfates) leaving clean water flow into the Partridge and Embarrass rivers and on into the St. Louis River and Lake Superior.\n\nCritics have assailed the potential of catastrophic dam failure at the site, noting the original dam was built using 1950s technology and engineering strategies. They also say the old LTV dam leaks, potentially allowing acidic copper mine waste into nearby waters.\n\nJon Cherry, PolyMet CEO, released a statement Friday calling the draft permit release another sign of progress toward buildout of the mine.\n\n\"The tailings basin was one of the most studied aspects of the NorthMet Project during the comprehensive state and federal environmental review of the project that concluded in 2016,\" Cherry said. \"We take the design, construction and operation of the tailings impoundment very seriously and have taken extra measures to ensure a safe and stable design. The science shows that not only can we be protective of water and other natural resources, but we will make a substantial contribution to addressing legacy reclamation issues at the former LTV site.\"\n\nEngineers for the PolyMet project say the tailings basin is being designed to handle a massive 1,000-year-type rainfall, in excess of 20 inches in a short period, with added wave action factored in for storms. That means building-in excess capacity to prevent \"overtopping'\" when water spills over a dam, often causing erosion or a break.\n\nThat kind of overtopping contributed to massive mine dam failures in both Canada and Brazil, each sending millions of gallons of tainted mine waste and water downstream.\n\nPolyMet also plans to leave a permanent pond on top of the mine waste basin even after the mine is closed. The hope is the water will act as a barrier to rob any acid-generating rock from a key element -- oxygen -- needed to cause pollution. Because most of the new tailings will be deposited underwater in the basin, \"the amount of tailings that will be exposed to oxygen and thus have the ability to release heavy metals will be limited,\" the company says.\n\nIt's likely the water on the mine waste will need to be contained forever and any water leaving the site will need to be filtered in some manner, either ongoing reverse osmosis or some new technology.\n\nThe DNR also released a second draft dam safety permit that covers PolyMet's proposed hydrometallurgical residue facility, which would receive residue, mostly gypsum, generated from a process that would use pressure and temperature reactions to extract additional precious metals beyond what can be achieved by the primary processing facility. Polymet is hoping to build that facility in the future but not in its initial project.\n\nThe dam safety permits are considered among the most important for PolyMet, along with the DNR permit to mine that's expected to be released later this year. If and when PolyMet gets all the necessary permits, possibly by 2018, the company will have to find an estimated $550 million to start construction.\n\nToronto-based PolyMet is proposing to build an open-pit copper-nickel mine and processing plant north of Hoyt Lakes that will employ about 300 people for 20 years or more -- the company's first and only mining project. The proposal has cleared the state environmental review process and now awaits more than 20 state and federal permits before work can start. The company, which is now one-third owned by Swiss commodities giant Glencore, also must raise money to pay for construction, likely $500 million or more.\n\nSupporters say the copper project will help diversify the Iron Range economy now heavily dependent on cyclical iron ore mining while critics say the high-sulfur rock where copper is located threatens to cause acidic pollution to the region's pristine waters.\n\nThe permit can be seen at www.dnr.state.mn.us\/polymet\/permitting\/ and any comments should include the words \"NorthMet Dam Safety\" or \"NorthMet Public Waters\" in the title of their comment emails or letters.
