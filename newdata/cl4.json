The militants have claimed other attacks in Britain this year, including two in London and one at a pop concert in Manchester.\nThe attack at Parsons Green tube station prompted the government to take the rare step of deploying soldiers.\n\"For this period, military personnel will replace police officers on guard duties at certain protected sites,\" May said in a televised statement.\n\"The public will see more armed police on the transport network and on our streets providing extra protection. This is a proportionate and sensible step which will provide extra reassurance and protection while the investigation progresses.\"\nThe bomb struck as passengers were traveling to the center of the British capital. Some suffered burns and others were injured in a stampede to escape from the station, one of the above-ground stops on the underground \"Tube\" network. Health officials said none was thought to be in a serious condition.\nPictures taken at the scene showed a slightly charred white plastic bucket in supermarket shopping bag on the floor of a carriage with wires coming out of the top.\n\"I was on the second carriage from the back. I just heard a kind of 'whoosh'. I looked up and saw the whole carriage engulfed in flames making its way towards me,\" Ola Fayankinnu, who was on the train, told Reuters.\n\"There were phones, hats, bags all over the place and when I looked back I saw a bag with flames.\"\nBritain's most senior counter-terrorism officer Mark Rowley said late on Friday that the investigation was progressing well.\n\"We are chasing down suspects,\" he said. \"Hundreds of police officers are pursuing numerous lines of enquiry, trawling through hours of CCTV footage and speaking to witnesses.\"\n\n (Reporting by Kate Holton; editing by
