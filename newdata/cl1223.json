Here's how getting involved can help you keep your outgoings in check.\n\nGo travelling on the cheap\n\nKeep an eye out for fundraising trips abroad run by your students' union, or posters for the notorious jailbreak challenge, which requires you and your friends to cover as much distance as possible in a set length of time without spending a penny.\n\nGet a discount on exercise classes\n\nOften run on both a pay-per-class and single membership basis, aerobics, yoga, pilates or even pole exercise societies are a far more cost-effective way to attend classes than at a local or even campus gym, and they don't tie you down to a six or 12-month commitment.\n\nYou could alternatively try your hand at a new discipline that involves high intensity exercise, like ballroom dancing, gymnastics, or martial arts. Societies like these typically ask for a one-off yearly membership, which gets you free sessions, training and access to necessary equipment.\n\nSkip on a gym membership\n\nMost universities have a host of sports societies that are the ideal alternative to a treadmill or exercise bike. At Bath Spa University, a £45 annual membership will get you a free weekly swim with steam room access. \"It's cost effective and still lets you plan your gym time around your life and [class] timetable,\" says swim society member Megan Webb.\n\nWhile some sports clubs that play competitively in varsity Bucs fixtures can have bigger membership fees, these will often include access to otherwise off-limits facilities and social perks. Keep an eye out for power-lifting or weight-training clubs that could save youmoney on access to gym equipment.\n\nFind drinks deals in style\n\nCraft beer, wine and cocktail-making societies have been springing up across campuses offering an alternative to supermarket booze, as some students find themselves priced out of drinking in their city centres.\n\nJames Beeson helped set up the University of Exeter's Real Ale Society, which offers members subsidised brewery tours and special rates in Wetherspoons pubs through a discounted affiliation with the Campaign for Real Ale. \"We also ran homebrew competitions and made our own beer in our student flat, which worked out at less than £1 a pint,\" says Beeson, who now heads up all-things-beer website Beeson on Beer. \"I made far better friends through the society than I would have by going clubbing,\" he adds.\n\nWrite reviews for student media\n\nIf you're into gigs, films or theatre and like talking about it, the campus media can be a perfect place to stretch your critical faculties while often getting the same access as professional journalists.\n\nDuring my time running a student newspaper, I was amazed by the opportunities that came up for writers to attend ticketed events as an accredited reviewer, from London Fashion Week to Reading and Leeds Festival. Make the most of them, but please, please remember to file coherent copy -- on time.\n\nFind a home from home\n\nIf you're an international student, or you just want to meet others from a similar cultural or ethnic background, it's likely that your uni will have a relevant student society. Be it Afro-Caribbean society, Irish society or Chinese society, you'll often find that such groups plan trips, events and socials. They can be a great way to conjure the essence of home in a sociable and cost-efficient way.\n\nGet a deal on the arts\n\nMany universities have their own take on a theatregoers society, offering discounted tickets on the basis of bulk orders. Others have art societies with access to resources and facilities that would otherwise be reserved only for art students. At Edinburgh, you can get gallery tours, life drawing classes and workshops for a £5 annual membership. Durham's art society goes one better, offering a free-to-use studio and basic materials, workshops and student gallery exhibitions, all for £6 a year.\n\nBecome a student cinema member\n\nStudent cinema societies manage to get latest releases shown in lecture theatres and screening rooms on campus at a fraction of the price of the local Odeon or Picturehouse. Tickets become even cheaper for paid-up members. Warwick's Student Cinema, for instance, is the largest society on the campus, running regular competitions on Facebook offering free tickets and managing an impressive five screenings a week.\n\nFollow Guardian Students on Twitter: @GdnStudents.
