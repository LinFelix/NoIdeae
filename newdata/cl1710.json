The story revealed that Clarke's 2013 thesis, entitled \"Making U.S. security and privacy rights compatible,\" contained language lifted from numerous sources, including multiple ACLU reports, the 9\/11 Commission Report,\n\nThe Washington Post, former President George W. Bush's book \"Decision Points\" and others. In all the instances KFile found, Clarke credited sources with a footnote but did not indicate with quotation marks that he was using the language verbatim.\n\nPrior to the May story, Clarke said that he would be joining President Donald Trump's administration as assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security. In June, DHS announced that Clarke was no longer under consideration for the position. In August, he resigned his position as sheriff and announced the following week that he would join the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action.\n\nThe Naval Postgraduate School's dean of students, Cdr. Paul Rasmussen, wrote in a July letter to Clarke obtained by KFile that he concurred with a finding of an\n\n\"Honor Code Board\" that the thesis was \"in violation\" of the school's honor code. The dean wrote that he further determined that Clarke's \"violation was not a result of any intentional deception or misappropriation efforts.\" The letter informed Clarke that he had until October 23 -- 100 days -- to submit a revised thesis or NPS would \"initiate degree revocation.\"\n\nClarke did not respond to a request for comment on the school's decision.\n\nClarke, who was a vocal supporter of President Trump's during the 2016 campaign, recently resigned his position as Milwaukee County, Wisconsin's Sheriff and was reportedly in line for some kind of position inside the Trump White House. Chief of Staff John Kelly apparently objected to the idea and Clarke was not offered such a position. Instead, he now works for a pro-Trump SuperPAC in a role that is likely to make him a prominent Trump surrogate on cable news. Before that, there had been reports that Clarke was offered a position at the Department of Homeland Security, but that offer was withdrawn after the plagiarism charges came to light.\n\nWhile Clarke has not responded to the latest news, his initial comments after the plagiarism allegations are about what you'd expect from a Trump supporter:","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 19:53:24.337"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 19:53:23.888","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|3Qx8Y0M+cpTydL7lJC5wB74\/dRk=|YnocPSd3O3kz59q9XgAmr1w6pJKMz0kS6H5jlgirUjTnVRYDIlCM1w==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b14096d0-9250-327e-8559-6e3bbc992cb2\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.868,"name":"Law_Crime"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b14096d0-9250-327e-8559-6e3bbc992cb2\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b14096d0-9250-327e-8559-6e3bbc992cb2\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b14096d0-9250-327e-8559-6e3bbc992cb2\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/359e9bfd-d04d-3ee5-931a-c69b04eac8d2","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"United States","importance":"1","originalValue":"United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b14096d0-9250-327e-8559-6e3bbc992cb2\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b14096d0-9250-327e-8559-6e3bbc992cb2\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/f71ba5a5-389e-3a2f-818b-278a17dcd775","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Conservatism in the United States","importance":"1","originalValue":"Conservatism in the United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b14096d0-9250-327e-8559-6e3bbc992cb2\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b14096d0-9250-327e-8559-6e3bbc992cb2\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/1e8c3989-b095-394e-9047-572257c9587c","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"David Clarke","importance":"1","originalValue":"David Clarke (sheriff)"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b14096d0-9250-327e-8559-6e3bbc992cb2\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b14096d0-9250-327e-8559-6e3bbc992cb2\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/70a49b00-55d8-3dca-a88f-e26b86216054","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Donald Trump","importance":"2","originalValue":"Donald Trump"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b14096d0-9250-327e-8559-6e3bbc992cb2\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b14096d0-9250-327e-8559-6e3bbc992cb2\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/31efd6c9-51ee-344a-9a1e-238d310df0f1","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Naval Postgraduate School","importance":"2","originalValue":"Naval Postgraduate School"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b14096d0-9250-327e-8559-6e3bbc992cb2\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Broadcasting -
