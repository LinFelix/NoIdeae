It said Mandiant was brought in\non Aug. 2 after Equifax's security team initially observed\n\"suspicious network traffic\" on July 29.\nThe company has hired public relations companies DJE\nHoldings and McGinn and Company to manage its response to the\nhack, PR Week reported. Equifax and the two PR firms declined to\ncomment on the report.\nEquifax's share prices has fallen by more than a third since\nthe company disclosed the hack on Sept. 7. Shares shed 3.8\npercent on Friday to close at $92.98.\nU.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has built a reputation as\na fierce consumer champion, kicked off a new round of attacks on\nEquifax on Friday by introducing a bill along with 11 other\nsenators to allow consumers to freeze their credit for free. A\ncredit freeze prevents thieves from applying for a loan using\nanother person's information.\nWarren also signaled in a letter to the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau, the agency she helped create in the wake of\nthe 2007-2009 financial crisis, that it may require extra powers\nto ensure closer federal oversight of credit reporting agencies.\nWarren also wrote letters to Equifax and rival credit\nmonitoring agencies TransUnion and Experian,\nfederal regulators and the Government Accountability Office to\nsee if new federal legislation was needed to protect consumers.\nConnecticut Attorney General George Jepsen and more than 30\nothers in a state group investigating the breach acknowledged\nthat Equifax has agreed to give free credit monitoring to hack\nvictims but pressed the company to stop collecting any money to\nmonitor or freeze credit.\n\"Selling a fee-based product that competes with Equifax's\nown free offer of credit monitoring services to victims of\nEquifax's own data breach is unfair,\" Jepsen said.\nAlso on Friday, the chairman and ranking member of the\nSenate subcommittee on Social Security urged Social Security\nAdministration to consider nullifying its contract with Equifax\nand consider making the company ineligible for future government\ncontracts.\nThe two senators, Republican Bill Cassidy and Democrat\nSherrod Brown, said they were concerned that personal\ninformation maintained by the Social Security Administration may\nalso be at risk because the agency worked with Equifax to build\nits E-Authentication security platform.\nEquifax has reported that for 2016, state and federal\ngovernments accounted for 5 percent of its total revenue of $3.1\nbillion.\n\n400,000 BRITONS AFFECTED\nEquifax, which disclosed the breach more than a month after\nit learned of it on July 29, said at the time that thieves may\nhave stolen the personal information of 143 million Americans in\none of the largest hacks ever.\nThe problem is not restricted to the United States.\nEquifax said on Friday that data on up to 400,000 Britons\nwas stolen in the hack because it was stored in the United\nStates. The data included names, email addresses and telephone\nnumbers but not street addresses or financial data, Equifax\nsaid.\nCanada's privacy commissioner said on Friday that it has\nlaunched an investigation into the data breach. Equifax is still\nworking to determine the number of Canadians affected, the\nOffice of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada said in a\nstatement.\n(Reporting by Dustin Volz and Diane Bartz; Additional
