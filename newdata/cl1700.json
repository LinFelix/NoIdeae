I've been asked to help a friend's daughter (late 20s) with a budgeting plan to enable her to start to save towards a home deposit. I was wondering if you could recommend a budgeting app that would be appropriate. I'm a bit old school with this, as have been doing an annual budget for that long now it's become second nature, but I'm sure a 20-something will use an app more. Hoping you can give me some assistance with newer technology for budgeting to pass on. - Kerry, Sydney\n\nI asked finder.com.au to do a quick Google poll for you, Kerry, and of 772 respondents, 31 per cent used a budgeting tool in the past year. In choosing this tool, they valued ease of use over all else, but cost and privacy were the next-most sought-after features.\n\nFor my money, quite literally, I can't go past the free Budget Planner at ASIC's moneysmart.gov.au. This is actually a spreadsheet but prompts you to enter your expenses in every category and has embedded formulae that then analyse and neatly show you your overall financial position.\n\nThis will allow your friend's daughter to identify her capacity to save - and perhaps see where she can curb costs to increase this. See my article last week on the six websites I recommend to cut your so-called fixed expenses and find lost money.\n\nRelated Articles Six places to find extra money 'Credit repair' agencies charging a fortune for something you can do yourself\n\nTo monitor and manage her day-to-day spending, Money Smart also offers a free app. Called TrackMySPEND, you can watch how close you are getting to a nominated spending limit. And there's a nice little visual display of which spending falls into wants and which into needs (as defined by the user). The downside is you have to manually input your transactions.\n\nInterestingly, the Acorns automatic-round-up-then-invest app, to which you link a transactional bank account of your choice, now categorises your spending so you can see where your \"living\" money goes too. (By the way, ignore the hoo-ha about the annual fee; it's irrelevant once you reach about $1000 invested - or if you start with that, which you probably would do if you instead invested through a broker.)\n\nOf course there are dedicated, commercial budgeting apps. Pocketbook, or getpocketbook.com, also syncs with your bank, is highly rated and won Finder's best personal finance app in 2016. A particularly good feature is notifications when you've been charged bank fees.\n\nYou certainly have some decent options to recommend Kerry. Just be sure to explain to your friend's daughter that it's best to save into a high-interest bank account any money you will need in the next five years.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Money Newsletter Money Newsletter\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nNicole Pedersen-McKinnon is a money educator and consumer advocate: themoneymentorway.com.
