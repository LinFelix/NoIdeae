So I started out 18 months ago with just a few of us.\n\n\"I think all the players are looking forward to it and I think in some ways we have outdone ourselves as we have got more players than kit!\"\n\nThe 18-game season for Cornard will run right through until March, with Stearns saying a successful season would involve 'winning half our games'.\n\nBut the club's most recent match, a home friendly defeat to Clacton Bombers on Saturday, provided a rude\n\nawakening.\n\n\"It was a big eye-opener,\" Stearns said.\n\nHe explained a mix of playing abilities have joined with six foot 11 inch Cornard lad Jonny Hall set to star from centre when not playing for Ipswich in the National League. While 6ft 8in Neil Thompson has been appointed captain.\n\nStearns, 38, who will be registered to play himself, thanked assistant coach Alex Deane and treasurer Claire Hyee for all their help in getting the club up-and-running.\n\nn The club, who have a Facebook page 'Cornard Kings basketball' are looking for a sponsor for their shirts, anyone interested is asked to call Stuart Stearns on 07866 353963","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 19:31:35.489"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 19:31:34.991","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|fcWMjLEh07We4AEP+FE\/NzVppzI=|Id9iCbKIcOMEyjRq\/D4xKQtYmWgr0enbOaL312JnL+1Jm622igDoUw==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/3a904691-747f-378d-ac14-d649f3e74d41\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":1,"name":"Sports"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/3a904691-747f-378d-ac14-d649f3e74d41\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/3a904691-747f-378d-ac14-d649f3e74d41\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/3a904691-747f-378d-ac14-d649f3e74d41\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/778501b7-29b2-30a5-b6d8-d7db8b245820","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Cornard","importance":"1","originalValue":"Cornard"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/3a904691-747f-378d-ac14-d649f3e74d41\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/3a904691-747f-378d-ac14-d649f3e74d41\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/a2e3feb5-0946-3819-8332-8484f9e538da","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Stearns","importance":"1","originalValue":"Stearns"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/3a904691-747f-378d-ac14-d649f3e74d41\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/3a904691-747f-378d-ac14-d649f3e74d41\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/d0eb3ac3-533d-3f07-8180-8269117bcd9b","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"English footballers","importance":"1","originalValue":"English footballers"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/3a904691-747f-378d-ac14-d649f3e74d41\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Water Utilities -
