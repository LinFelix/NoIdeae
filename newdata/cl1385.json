The findings also show that food security has worsened in some peaceful places amid economic slowdowns, while 13 percent of adults are battling obesity.\n\nChildren cross a body of water to reach a registration area prior to a food distribution carried out by the United Nations World Food Programme in South Sudan in February.

Famine was declared earlier this year in South Sudan, while Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen have suffered more food shortages. The increase in the undernourished also came as a gauge of food prices rebounded from a seven-year low, even amid a global glut of grains.\n\nSome key findings:\n\nn One-fifth of those in Africa and 12 percent in Asia were hungry.\n\nn 155 million children under 5 were too short for their age.\n\nn 52 million children aren't heavy enough for their height.\n\nn One-third of people in eastern Africa were undernourished.\n\nn Adult obesity is also rising everywhere at a faster pace.\n\nWhile the number of undernourished people around the world last year rose to the highest level since 2008, it was still about 14 percent below a peak set in 2003.\n\nThe situation is likely to improve this year, U.N. FAO Secretary General Jose Graziano da Silva said at a press conference in Rome, citing an improving economy, fading odds of El Nino and progress made in conflict-affected areas.\n\nShare\n\nSend questions\/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?
