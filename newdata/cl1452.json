For many students, it's the most stressful time of their young lives. But, across Maitland, a local youth worker has tried to put some of the nervous young minds at rest by handing out HSC Survival Packs.\n\nPREPARING: Year 12 students at Maitland Christian High School were among those who received HSC survival kits from youth worker Tessa Staines. Pictures: Alysha Garrett\n\nMaitland Grossman High School youth worker Tessa Staines has spent the past four years handing out the survival packs to students across the Hunter. The 210 students who received the packs found both silly and significant items in their bags ranging from a packet of tissues to a game of uno.\n\nMs Staines said that although the HSC marks the end of school; it's just the beginning of a new and exciting chapter in their lives.\n\nSTRESS BUSTERS: Youth worker Tessa Staines' HSC survival kits include light-hearted and practical trinkets designed to de-stress students.\n\n\"These packs are a reminder of the larger community that are supporting, encouraging and believing in the students during such a anxious time in their lives,\" she said.\n\n\"Not all students go well, and it's okay not to be academic, but it's inspiring to see kids getting in there and giving it a go. Just to receive the piece of paper is amazing, good marks are just a bonus.\n\n\"Students need to know that the HSC isn't the be all and end all. There are so many pathways to the future they want to have. There are so many things to look forward to when they finish school.\"\n\nMaitland Christian School student Aaron Sherrit said there was a lot of anxiety amongst the students in the lead up of the exams.\n\n\"It's stressful, but I'm keen to get through it. The kit will help brighten me up a bit when the stress really starts to hit.\"\n\nFellow student Kiri Whatham, who's planning on studying Occupational Therapy at the University of Newcastle next year, says she's also nervous about sitting her HSC next month.\n\n\"I'm still in the end of school mode, so once school's over it should sink in. I'm pretty happy with my preparation, but there's still a long way to go.\"\n\nThe first exams - English Advanced and Standard - will be held at 10.20am on Thursday October 13. Anyone stressed about the HSC contact Lifeline - 13 11 14.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
