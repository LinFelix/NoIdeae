Each country to deploy 500 observers\n* Deal marks shift in Turkey's policy\n* But details such as locations are yet to be agreed\n* Idlib is one of four agreed de-escalation zones\n* Trio start talks on Syrian reconciliation bodies\n(Adds Assad aide comments)\nBy Ece Toksabay and Raushan Nurshayeva\nANKARA\/ASTANA, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Russia, Iran and Turkey\nwill post observers on the edge of a de-escalation zone in\nnorthern Syria's Idlib region largely controlled by Islamist\nmilitants, the three nations said on Friday.\nThe move is part of a broader plan under which Moscow,\nTehran and Ankara will set up four such zones in different parts\nof Syria, an idea described by critics as de facto partitioning\nof the war-torn nation.\nWhile they hailed the agreement as a breakthrough after\nmonths of talks, Moscow, Tehran and Ankara provided very few\ndetails and said some issues were still to be worked out.\nThey denied charges of aiming to partition the country,\nhowever, saying the zones where they plan to deploy forces would\nbe temporary, although they could be extended beyond an initial\nsix-month term.\nA top aide to President Bashar al-Assad, Bouthaina Shaaban,\nsaid attempts to divide Syria had failed, and reiterated the\ngovernment's vow to take back the entire country, including\n\"Idlib and other areas\".\nTurkey's foreign ministry and Russian and Iranian diplomats\nwho attended trilateral talks in Kazakhstan said on Friday their\nobservers would be stationed in \"safe zones\" along the border of\nthe Idlib de-escalation area.\nThe Turkish ministry said in a statement the observers'\nmission will be to prevent clashes between \"the (Syrian) regime\nand the opposition forces, and any violations of the truce\".\nRussian negotiator Alexander Lavrentyev said the trio will\neach send about 500 observers to Idlib, and the Russians will be\nmilitary policemen.\nIdlib province, in northwest Syria on the border with\nTurkey, is largely controlled by a rebel alliance spearheaded by\nthe former al Qaeda offshoot Nusra Front.\nOne analyst was unsure how effective the deal would be.\n\"I'm not sure what this deal means in practice or how or if\nit is going to get implemented on the ground,\" said Aron Lund, a\nSyria specialist and fellow at The Century Foundation.\n\"The obvious stumbling block is the fact that much of Idlib\nis under the control of Tahrir al-Sham, which is viewed\ninternationally as a terrorist group.\"\n\nDEVIL IN THE DETAILS\nA deal with Russia and Iran, which support President Bashar\nAssad's government, marks a shift in the policy of Ankara, which\nbacks some of the rebels and raised objections to Russia and\nIran's proposals at a previous meeting in July.\nBut the details of the plan remained unclear as the three\ncountries did not make public any of the documents agreed on\nFriday apart from their joint statement.\nRussia's Lavrentyev said that the exact deployment locations\nof de-escalation control forces in Idlib had yet to be\ndetermined.\nYezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East\nCentre, said the agreement could pave way for an offensive\nagainst Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).\n\"The calls to form a 'unified opposition army' in the\nnorthwest under the aegis of groups close to the Muslim\nBrotherhood suggest that Turkey is preparing a proxy force to\nmove against HTS in western Aleppo and Idlib: as in al-Bab and\nJarablus, Turkish units would support opposition forces from\nbehind,\" he said.\nA Western diplomat said it was \"still unclear what the final\noutcome will be, notwithstanding there was just a closing\nceremony\".\n\"How much devil will be in the detail remains to be seen,\"\nthe diplomat said.\nMeanwhile, the Astana trio have started discussing setting\nup national reconciliation committees in Syria and will continue\nthose discussions in late October, Lavrentyev said.\nThe United Nations, which hosts separate Syria peace talks\nin Geneva, has previously urged Astana to focus on consolidating\nthe ceasefire and avoid political matters.\n(Additional reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu in Ankara and Tom\nPerry, John
