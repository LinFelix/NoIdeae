So something's not right.\"\n\nMoran, a physics teacher by profession, said she had seen first hand the effect league tables had on teaching priorities.\n\nShe said: \"There was a list of students on the wall of the staff room that was colour coded red, green and yellow.\n\n\"The red students were the ones who were never going to get 5 good GCSEs. The greens were the ones who were OK so let's not let them slip. And the yellows were the ones that if we pushed them a bit they were going to make it.\n\n\"And we were told in no uncertain terms, focus on the yellows, make sure the greens don't go anywhere and just kind of ignore the reds.\n\n\"It was, you know 'Do your best with them, make them feel nice, but you're not going to be able to push them.\"\n\nMoran, who unseated Tory minister Nicola Blackwood in Oxford West and Abingdon in June's election, said private schools were successful because they spent more resources on low attainment pupils.\n\n\"They focus on the reds,\" she said. \"And that's how they bring attainment up for everyone, overall.\"\n\nIn her speech to conference, she said tuition fees were the \"pink dancing elephant in the room.\"\n\nShe added: \"I believe it's time that we completely re-imagined them too.\n\n\"The thing is, I do believe that education is a public good and should be freely accessible.\n\n\"But I also believe that only supporting the 40% of people who decide early enough that that's the path for them is fundamentally unfair.\"\n\nMs Moran cited the example of Christine, who she met studying a masters degree in her 30s.\n\n\"What about those who study part time, or need to retrain,\" Ms Moran said.\n\n\"Or want to embark on a vocational course, but have family responsibilities and can't make ends meet?\n\n\"What if we found a way for the state to help people access further education at any point in their lives?\n\n\"Now, many would choose to go do that and go to university at 18, but equally they could do it via a completely different route, later.\n\n\"At a time that is right for them, in a way that suits them, not when and how the state dictates they should.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
