You go from scrambling for a par to making three (birdies) in a row,\" said the laid-back Leishman.\nThe world number 22 has won twice on the PGA Tour, including the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida in March.\nLeishman cannot, however, boast the best halfway score ever at Conway Farms, an honour that belongs to Day, who plundered the layout two years ago on his way to a victory that vaulted him to number one in the world.\nDay's seven-iron at the 188-yard 17th on Friday landed in the rough just in front of the green, took a couple of bounces and trickled into the hole, much to his surprise.\n\"We were trying to land it 182 (yards) and I kind of pushed it. It was a lucky hole-in-one, I guess,\" Day said after his second ace on tour.\nHe also had an eagle, a chip-in from 30 feet from beyond the green at the par-five 14th.\n\"(I am) very pleased with how the last two days went,\" Day said. \"I can't get too far ahead of myself. Last time I was here I was five shots better (after 36 holes). I've got to somehow try to catch up to my number. That's the main goal.\"\nFowler also finished with a rush, picking up five strokes in the final six holes.\nThe BMW Championship is the third of four playoff events on the PGA Tour. The top points earner after next week's Tour Championship will receive a $10 million bonus awarded to the season-long FedExCup champion.\nPoints leader Thomas carded 70 to fall 11 strokes behind Leishman. Second-placed Spieth also shot 70 to trail by nine.
