McFarland Distinguished Professor in Leadership for Educational Policy and Reform in the College of Education at the University of Arizona. He is a Fellow of the American Educational Research Association.\n\nMilem's research focuses on the ways in which colleges and universities can be organized to enhance equity, access and success for all students; the racial context within higher education; and the relationship between how colleges and universities organize themselves and student outcomes and faculty role performance.\n\nAs a recognized expert in the area of racial dynamics in higher education, Milem has been commissioned to do research by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Harvard Civil Rights Project, the American Council on Education, the Association of American Colleges and Universities, and the American Educational Research Association's Panel on Racial Dynamics in Higher Education.\n\nWith his colleagues Mitchell Chang and Anthony Antonio, Milem co-authored Making Diversity Work on Campus: A Research Based Perspective, published by the Association of American Colleges and Universities.\n\nThe work translates research demonstrating the educational benefits of diversity to develop a roadmap for college leaders of the conditions that must be in place if they are to maximize the opportunities for teaching and learning that racial diversity provides.\n\nMilem contributed to two books that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor cited in her majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger as being influential in helping to document the university's claim regarding the educational benefits of diversity.\n\nMilem was a faculty member at the University of Maryland and Vanderbilt University. He earned his B.A. in political science from Michigan State University, his M.Ed. from the University of Vermont, and his Ph.D. from UCLA.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
