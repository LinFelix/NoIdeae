Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina on Saturday left for New York to attend the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), where she will be raising the issue of Rohingya crisis.\n\nShe will also make a formal proposal at the upcoming session for an early implementation of recommendations by the Kofi Annan-led Commission.\n\nThe Advisory Commission recommended that the Myanmar Government take concrete steps to end the enforced segregation of Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims; ensure full and unfettered humanitarian access throughout the state; tackle Rohingya statelessness and \"revisit\" the 1982 Citizenship Law; hold perpetrators of human rights violations accountable; and end restrictions on freedom of movement, among other recommendations.\n\nPrime Minister's office said that Hasina will depart from Abu Dhabi for New York tomorrow morning, The Daily Star reported.\n\nShe will be addressing the UNGA on September 21.\n\nHasina will also urge the world leaders to play an effective role in stopping the genocide of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.\n\nThe Rohingya Muslims, who have taken refuge in Cox's Bazar and Teknaf border areas in Bangladesh after they fled the barbarous persecution in Myanmar's Rakhine state, are now suffering due to an absence of food, shelters, medicines, sanitation facilities and clean water.\n\nThe United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR, said around 4,00,000 refugees have fled from the violence-affected Myanmar's Northern Rakhine state and sought refuge in Bangladesh, where the limited shelter capacity is already exhausted.\n\nMany of over 3,50,000 refugees, staying either under open sky or at the new refugee camps and shelters, are suffering from diarrhea and different diseases and don't have an access to even clean drinking water and proper medicines.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
