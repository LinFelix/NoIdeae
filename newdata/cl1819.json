Oxford was number one, with Bristol at number two and Brighton and Hove coming in third.\n\nCambridge has also fared pretty poorly in other aspects - it was voted the worst city for travelling in and out of , and also the most unequal city in the UK .\n\nBut Cambridge has ranked highly in other surveys - residents in Cambridge were voted to have the third sexiest accent in England last month.\n\nIn response to the survey Emma Thornton, chief executive of Visit Cambridge, set up to promote and encourage tourism in the city, said: \"Cambridge is a great place to live and visit because it is a city which has so much to offer.\n\n\"There's beautiful architecture steeped in history, a fantastic and rich arts and cultural scene, great shopping and choice of restaurants with beautiful open green spaces.\n\n\"As well as all of that, the river is only minutes' walk from all the hustle and bustle.\"\n\nThe study, commissioned by the 9NINE Super Seed brand, asked 3,000 Brits to consider their general life satisfaction and rate how they feel on a scale of one to ten.\n\nOxford came top in the life satisfaction stakes with a score of 6.72 out of ten, while Edinburgh found itself at the bottom of the table with a life satisfaction average of 5.89 out of ten.\n\nMarketing Director Kerry Collinge, for 9NINE Super Seed brand, said: \"Brighton residents have found themselves topping our happiest city chart.\n\nOld Cambridge picture quiz View gallery\n\nOld Cambridge picture quiz\n\nView gallery\n\n\"Maybe it's the sea air and sunny weather that keeps them smiling.\"\n\nWhen asked to rate their life satisfaction on a scale from one to ten, the average Brit gave themselves a middling 6.37 out of ten.\n\nJust one in ten rated their life satisfaction at nine or above, indicating excellent life satisfaction.\n\nResearchers also looked into the ways we boost our mood - and found three in five look to bed for comfort in hard times, and over half lean on family for support.\n\nForty three per cent play their favourite music when they need to raise their spirits, with reading a book proving more popular for boosting our serotonin levels than sex.\n\nBut it's the typical British weather which is most likely to get us feeling down in the dumps first place, with 40 per cent claiming inclement weather has a negative effect on their emotions.\n\nIt also emerged the average Brit believes they will be at their happiest at the age of 33, with just over a third think their best years are now behind them.\n\nBut an optimistic fifth think they are currently having the time of their lives.\n\nThe happiest cities in the UK\n\n1.
