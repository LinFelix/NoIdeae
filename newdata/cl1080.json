The pollsters got it wrong. Few people within the Trump camp, up to and including the candidate himself, believed they were about to pull off the biggest upset in American political history.\n\nAnd yet, just over 10 months later, here we are.\n\nThe release of former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's book What Happened this week is only the latest entry into a crowded field.\n\nOf course, any attempt by Clinton to understand and explain what happened -- no matter how fact-based and carefully crafted -- will be seen by many as excuse-making, if not sour grapes.\n\nThere is honesty in this account, but also spin. Clinton accepts full responsibility for her loss while deflecting most of the blame onto others. Vladimir Putin and James Comey are among the usual suspects, but even Bernie Sanders is called to account.\n\nClinton fills out nearly 500 pages with her view on exactly what happened in the campaign and the election. But this is not the full story: only Clinton's perspective on it.\n\nWhatever else you want to say about the election and Trump's impact, the story has been a boon for the publishing industry, generating a tsunami of books seeking to explain various aspects of the Trump phenomenon. And, as Trump's administration continues to court controversy, we can be sure his presidency will be the gift that keeps on giving to biographers, cultural analysts and political reporters.\n\nFor now, here's a quick guide to recent guides for the perplexed.\n\nThe big picture\n\nThe Retreat of Western Liberalism by Edward Luce: A succinct and powerful accounting of the global failure of the political left and the subsequent revolt of the people against a system that they see, not without reason, as having failed and abandoned them. Luce takes a global view of this sea change in our politics and his analysis of how it all relates to the rise of Trump, and the failure of Hillary Clinton, is spot on.\n\nThe Trump voter\n\nTwilight of American Sanity by Allen Frances: For the record, psychiatrist Frances doesn't think Trump suffers from narcissistic personality disorder or any other disabling mental illness. Instead, he sees him as \"a kind of secular antichrist, leading his supporters into an apocalypse of societal delusion.\" In other words, he's not mad, but the people who voted for him are.\n\nThe Dangerous Case of Donald Trump edited by Bandy X. Lee: If, on the other hand, you are inclined to think that Trump really is mad you might find support for that view in this collection of essays by 27 psychiatrists and mental health experts who are part of the \"duty to warn\" movement, an association of professionals united by the idea that it is their ethical responsibility to warn the public about the dangers posed by Trump's mental health (out Oct. 3).\n\nHow the Right Lost Its Mind by Charles J. Sykes: Conservative pundit Sykes analyzes the dark tribal forces that dragged the right into the alt-right, ending with a program for how to return to sanity. \"After Trump's defeat of Hillary Clinton, the Democrats need to perform an autopsy; Republicans need an exorcism\" (out Oct. 3).\n\nThe election\n\nDevil's Bargain by Joshua Green: Trump and his former campaign manager, Steve Bannon, are no longer besties, but Green makes a strong case for Bannon having been a necessary figure in Trump's election: the intellectual power behind his rise to the throne as well as his media enabler-in-chief.\n\nUnbelievable: My Front-Row Seat to the Craziest Campaign in American History by Katy Tur: It's probably fair to say that NBC reporter Tur didn't know what she was in for when she was assigned the job of following Trump's long and crazy road to the White House. Before long she was being called out by name by the candidate at rallies and booed by crowds of thousands. As much a story about covering Trump as it is about Trump himself, Tur's perspective on the campaign is both informative and uniquely well-placed.\n\nThe Destruction of Hillary Clinton by Susan Bordo: In her account of what happened, feminist scholar Bordo calls out Bernie Sanders' primary campaign and sexism in general but places most of the blame on the mainstream media. This is a bit surprising, given that the media overwhelmingly endorsed Clinton for president, but recent analysis suggests Bordo has it right, at least up to a point. There was probably less deliberate sabotage involved than just the usual bias in the media toward scandal and outrage. This much, at least, Trump understood.\n\nShattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes: The fullest journalistic account of the Clinton campaign and one that doesn't shy away from laying most of the blame at the candidate's own feet. \"Hillaryland\" and \"Clintonworld\" are both words that get used a lot to describe the bubble she had built and which, in the end, left her woefully unprepared for the coming storm.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
