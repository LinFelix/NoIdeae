Spencer, the Alexandria, Virginia, resident who coined the term \"alt-right\" and has become its omnipresent spokesman, said he had no plans to join the pro-Trump forces mustering in Washington in light of the president's new willingness to shield illegal immigrants brought to the country as children from deportation.\n\n\"If anything, I would be protesting Trump this weekend,\" Spencer said in an interview.\n\nRead the latest news on U.S. President Donald Trump\n\nHis comments came as the nation's capital prepared to host what may be the year's most motley collection of political rallies Saturday, including the demonstration in support of the president, anti-Trump counter protests and a demonstration by fans of the rap-metal group Insane Clown Posse, who are protesting their FBI designation as a criminal gang.\n\nRead more: Trump and top Democrats reach deal on young immigrants\n\nTransgender troops can re-enlist in U.S. military for now, Pentagon says\n\nTrump's about-face on Dreamers leaves his anti-immigration supporters raging\n\nPolice in the District have worried about friction among the groups along the lines of the clashes between white supremacists and left-wing demonstrators that led to deadly rioting in Charlottesville last month.\n\nSpencer, who helped lead the white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville, said he doesn't expect those who share his conservatism to show up in force Saturday.\n\n\"It's a residue of an older conservatism,\" he said of the scheduled pro-Trump demonstration. \"It really doesn't have much of anything to do with the alt right.\"\n\nSuch distinctions could be lost on left-wing demonstrators in an overwhelmingly Democratic D.C. A Facebook group called \"White Supremacists Out of Washington!\" that was planning to gather at Farragut Square to protest the pro-Trump rally.\n\n\"The counter protest is to say, how can you defend someone who won't condemn white supremacy,\" said Nelini Stamp, an organizer of the counterprotest. After the violence in Charlottesville, Trump was heavily criticized for blaming protesters on \"both sides\" of the political spectrum rather than focusing on white supremacists.\n\nAuthorities had plans in place, including street restrictions, to keep order and separate the groups as necessary. Looming over them is the response in Charlottesville, where police were faulted for a slow reaction as the protest turned violent.\n\nThe D.C. Office of Police Complaints said in a statement that it would be monitoring the department's handling of the rallies. The office was planning to deploy its staff with video and audio recording equipment throughout downtown Saturday.\n\nD.C. police said there would be about 15 road closures around the Mall between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m., including the 9th and 12th street tunnels. Parts of C, D and E streets NW near the Mall are also among the closures.\n\nMetro announced that the Smithsonian station on the Mall will be closed. Trains on the Orange, Blue and Silver lines will run through the station Saturday but not stop.\n\nThe day's most anticipated events are the march of the Juggalos -- as Insane Clown Posse fans call themselves -- and the pro-Trump rally, which its organizers have dubbed the \"Mother of All Rallies.\"\n\nJason Webber, an organizer of the Juggalo rally, said the group is apolitical but noted that many of the band's songs decry bigotry. He said 3,000 people are planning to attend.\n\nPeter Boykin, president of Gays for Trump and a speaker at the conservative rally, said he expects a crowd ranging from 1,000 to 2,000.\n\nWebber and Boykin said they aren't expecting brawls.\n\n\"We think Washington D.C. is a great, safe place to have a rally, and I'm not looking for a fight,\" Boykin said.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 20:08:59.585"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 20:08:58.918","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|+zRvV9SmvKtNkqsRVbKjsANq5J8=|BtHZZlsrkhrhXMAitCrnrh8m4btXMb6MijkshlE97LDJAzBC9f3FPQ==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.766,"name":"Politics"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/b74bc272-d5fd-3140-a0ac-f12e84a4f115","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Presidency of Donald Trump","importance":"1","originalValue":"Presidency of Donald Trump"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/450a0fe4-479f-343b-8ca1-2ced72c6b3ef","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Politics of the United States","importance":"1","originalValue":"Politics of the United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/359e9bfd-d04d-3ee5-931a-c69b04eac8d2","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"United States","importance":"1","originalValue":"United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/d5e094c0-3627-3360-a6df-f0d7081dbeee","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Protests against Donald Trump","importance":"2","originalValue":"Protests against Donald Trump"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/8f015c9a-d645-3a84-b52a-d4e15a5e07d9","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Gays for Trump","importance":"2","originalValue":"Gays for Trump"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/ae9c8bd8-ecf3-333a-a85e-80b34d19bc29","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"LGBT conservatism","importance":"2","originalValue":"LGBT conservatism"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/7":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/7","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/70a49b00-55d8-3dca-a88f-e26b86216054","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Donald Trump","importance":"2","originalValue":"Donald Trump"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/8":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/8","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/381fc550-60ae-3974-8936-79b7569d7751","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Mother of All Rallies","importance":"2","originalValue":"Mother of All Rallies"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/9":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d9f29902-5f79-397d-825e-e61adaeb26ba\/SocialTag\/9","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/cfe54b78-b575-3337-a47f-123354d51244","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Richard B.
