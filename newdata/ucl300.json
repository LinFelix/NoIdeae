to correct spelling of \"Long Island Rail Road\" in 2nd\nparagraph)\nNEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The bombing of a packed London\ncommuter train on Friday prompted the operator of New York\nCity's subway system and two of the region's three major\ncommuter rail networks to announce beefed-up security measures\n\"out of an abundance of caution.\"\nMetropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the\nLong Island Rail Road and Metro-North commuter lines, said it\nwas closely monitoring the investigation of the fiery blast that\ninjured at least 22 people in a West London underground station.\nThe MTA will expand bag screening and deploy extra police\npatrols on the LIRR and Metro-North, as well as in midtown\nManhattan's Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station,\n\"out of an abundance of caution,\" spokesman Kevin Ortiz said.\nMTA officials were also consulting with New York City police\nabout bolstering security in the subway system, he said.\nThe NYPD said it has been in contact London law enforcement\nofficials and has added officers, some heavily armed, and\nbomb-sniffing dogs to the city's transit system.\nAmtrak, the country's nationwide passenger rail carrier,\nsaid it was closely following the events in London but was not\nadding to the layers of security it already has in place.\n\"Robust security measures are in place at stations, on\ntrains and along the tracks, and partnerships with federal\nagencies to gather intelligence information are underway,\"\nAmtrak said in a statement.\n\n\n(Reporting by Peter Szekely; Editing by Dan
