They also have a fixture card full of friendlies.\n\nCranborne has more than 40 playing and social members and is always looking for new ones.\n\nIt has numerous roll-up events at which potential members - men and women, young or old - are welcome to turn up to try out the sport.\n\nIts founder, Reg Booth, obtained a defunct tennis court on the recreation ground in 1962 and organised a working party to dig out the original three rinks before another was later added.\n\nThe homely clubhouse - which is still in use - is an old agricultural building thought to have been a chicken shed.\n\nClub captain Dawn Jones said: \"We would like to express our gratitude for the sponsorship from Douch & Small which will help us enjoy a long and successful future.\"\n\nPeter Douch, chairman of Douch Family Funeral Directors said: \"Following our relationship with Dawn Jones through her work with Partnership for Older People Programme in the Ferndown area, we heard she was a keen bowler and that her team were looking for sponsorship. We were only too pleased to help.\n\n\"Douch & Small in Wimborne has a long association with local groups and sports clubs and we actively try to do our bit for the communities we work in.\n\n\"Everyone at Cranborne is very friendly and they have a beautiful green. I look forward to many future visits.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
