Attendees will discover new experimental and inventive educational approaches as well as best practices that they can bring back to their faculty and classrooms.\n\nThe summit brings together educators from established game development programs with new game course creators that want to understand the challenges they'll face in the next few years. It is a great professional development opportunity that will explore how new areas of game education will advance the field for the next generation of students.\n\nSo who should be submitting? You should, if you're an inspired educator with some great ideas to share with others about teaching game design\/development, to improve everyone's practice.\n\nYou've done some ground-breaking work on your curriculum or research that we can all use to improve what we are doing with students. You have a unique point of view on teaching game design\/development that you haven't seen anywhere else, that you know could add value. You have an idea for a panel, and can assemble some great speakers from various schools to speak to a particular topic.\n\nWe are looking for new voices, so if you haven't submitted before, please consider doing so. There is probably something amazing and unique about how YOU do things that we would all benefit from hearing about. We are particularly interested in hearing from programs\/people who may not be regular attendees.\n\nThe audience for this Summit consists of educators of game development and studies (working in the context of community college, four-year college\/university and graduation education programs).\n\nMost attendees are at schools that already have well-established game programs and courses of study (or else they will be in a few short years, once they work the kinks out of a newly-developed program). We are soliciting the following topics for the 2018 program:\n\nAnnual lecture themes:\n\nTips for submissions, based on some common mistakes we've seen:","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
