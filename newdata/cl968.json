many environmental and animal rights groups, lab meat is seen as a positive move away from the slaughter of billions of animals\n\nChina has signed a $300m deal to purchase meat grown in a laboratory in Israel in a deal that could open a lucrative floodgate for vegan food manufacturers into the world's most populous country.\n\nLab meat - also known as cultured or bio meat - is grown in a laboratory using animal cells, making some vegans opposed to the concept - but several environmental and animal rights groups have welcomed it as an exciting development.\n\nBruce Friedrich, head of the Good Food Institute (GFI), an organisation which promotes meat alternatives, hailed the deal as a \"colossal market opportunity\".\n\nConsuming Issue: The truth about supermarket meat 2 show all Consuming Issue: The truth about supermarket meat 1\/2\n\nRSPCA\n\n2\/2\n\nReuters\n\nHe believes the deal \"could put [clean] meat onto the radar of Chinese officials who have the capacity to steer billions of dollars into this technology\".\n\nAlthough the use of animal cells means it is not entirely slaughter-free, scientists are currently working on developing a totally synthetic substitute.\n\nFor many environmental and animal rights groups, lab meat is seen as a positive move away from the slaughter of billions of animals, as well as being a greener option than traditional factory farming.\n\nChina is not generally regarded as a world leader in environmental issues, so its deal with three Israeli companies - SuperMeat, Future Meat Technologies, and Meat the Future - has been welcomed by some groups as a sign that China is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nRead more We need to end the meat and dairy industry altogether\n\nChina currently imports around Â£10bn worth of meat annually to help feed its population of more than 1.4 billion people.\n\nChina's communist government has outlined a plan to reduce its citizens' meat consumption by 50 per cent, in a move welcomed by climate campaigners as a way to mitigate global warming.\n\nAn estimated 14.5 per cent of the planet's global warming emissions stem from from the keeping and eating of livestock - more than from the entire transport sector.\n\nLivestock emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas, while land clearing and fertilisers release large quantities of carbon.\n\n\"Through this kind of lifestyle change, it is expected that the livestock industry will transform and carbon emissions will be reduced,\" said Li Junfeng, director general of China's National Center on Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation.\n\nA recent report by scientists at the Oxford Martin School found the widespread adoption of vegetarianism around the world could bring down greenhouse gas emissions by nearly two-thirds.\n\nMore about: China Israel Vegetarianism veganism greenhouse gases Reuse content","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
