Eissenstat declined to comment.\n\nWashington has said it would participate in UN climate change meetings during the withdrawal process, which is expected to take at least three years. It has also said it would consider participating in a new, renegotiated deal.\n\nCanadian environment minister Catherine McKenna said the participation of a U.S. delegation in Montreal was a positive sign.\n\n\"We continue to engage them,\" she said on the sidelines of the meeting. \"We continue to make the case that like the United States, we want to create jobs, we want to create economic growth.\"\n\nMcKenna added that climate-change initiatives could create $30 trillion in economic activity.\n\nThe Montreal gathering precedes larger UN climate talks in Bonn, Germany, in November, where devastation from Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean is expected to pit wealthy countries against small island nations who need help coping with damage attributable to climate change.\n\nIrma killed dozens of people and caused billions of dollars in damage across the Caribbean and Florida.\n\nRepresentatives from 11 European countries are slated to meet tomorrow to discuss U.S. climate policy in New York City with Gary Cohn, the president's National Economic Advisor.
