Terrifying CCTV footage and 999 call centre recordings, released by police, show the teen being chased by his former employers in a car through the streets of Darwen while his girlfriend pleaded for help - telling a 999 operator she feared they would be stabbed.\n\nWhen the car the dealer was in crashed he was chased through the streets until he sought refuge in a hotel.\n\n'FOOT SOLDIERS' GIVEN INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS TASKS\n\nThe use of children to avoid suspicion and reduce the risk of higher-ranking gang members being arrested is nothing new.\n\nOn Merseyside gangs have turned to impressionable teens to mind and transport guns and drugs, working on the basis they appear less suspicious to the authorities, and that they will face lighter sentences if caught.\n\nBut the way in which those children are exploited is becoming increasingly ruthless, while the jobs young 'foot-soldiers' are being given to do are becoming more dangerous.\n\nMerseyside Police say this case, which they began investigating in 2015, was one of the first in which they had seen young teens sent miles from home to act as outlying representatives for drugs gangs.\n\nOver recent years similar cases involving Merseyside gangs have come to light in other areas of the country.\n\nIn January, Carlisle Crown Court heard how a north Liverpool gang nicknamed 'Joeys' had drafted in a 15-year-old boy.\n\nThe teenager, from Merseyside, was sent to live in Barrow with a local man who was jailed as part of the Cumbria Police investigation.\n\nThe teen, who was given a Youth Referral Order, was enlisted to deliver drugs in the town on behalf of his bosses.\n\nGANGS TARGET CHILDREN FROM 'CHAOTIC HOMES' WITH ALLURE OF SECURITY AND WEALTH\n\nThe sad reality, according to expert reports, is that some teenagers are easy prey for gangs.\n\nA report that went before the Sefton Safer Communities Partnership (SSCP) and Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB) recently highlighted those who live in \"chaotic home environments\" are among those targeted.\n\nThe report said: \"Gang members target vulnerable young people by offering them 'something' (i.e. food and money) that is absent in the home.\n\n\"The young people may see this person as someone who 'cares' as they are providing them with things that they do not get from their parents.\n\n\"This is just one process of recruiting young people into gangs by using grooming methods.\n\n\"Absent fathers and a lack of a positive male role model is also a significant risk factor. Older gang members present themselves to young people as offering 'guidance' and they fill the gap in this young person's life.\"\n\nRUTHLESS THUGS 'STEAL FROM THEIR OWN' IN BID TO TRAP VULNERABLE IN UNDERWORLD\n\nOnce involved in underworld networks those teens who realise they are being taken advantage of are left with nowhere to turn.\n\nThose gang members that offer them protection will rule through fear - as highlighted in the Darwen police chase.\n\nAnd the more ruthless criminals will go further to trap their most vulnerable - and often most useful - assets.\n\nThere have been cases where street dealers have been given a consignment of drugs to look after, only for members of the same gang to then break into the dealer's home and steal the drugs back.\n\nWhen the dealer reveals to their superiors that they no longer have the drugs, they are told they are indebted and must work off the value of the lost merchandise.\n\nThe cruel tactic ensures those at the bottom - many of whom feel they cannot go to police because they are now involved in criminality themselves - do as they are told.\n\nWE NEED TO CHANGE THE LANGUAGE - THIS IS EXPLOITATION, SLAVERY... GROOMING\n\nSpeaking to the ECHO, Detective Superintendent Lee Turner said exploited children involved in criminality were difficult for the police to deal with - even though officers understood they were also victims.\n\nOne way of addressing the issue, he said, could be to change the terms of reference with which those guilty of targeting the vulnerable are dealt with.\n\nRather than simply being drug dealers, if they are charged with exploitation - or even modern slavery - offences, it may change the way in which they are seen once locked up. If their place on the hierarchy once in jail is challenged, some may think twice about their actions.\n\nAsked what advice he would give to someone trapped in a drugs gang, Det Supt Turner said: \"My advice would be to contact the police and if they don't feel they can there are lots of agencies they can contact - the NSPCC, Catch-22, lots of different charities.\n\n\"There will be someone in their life who can act as a support. That doesn't necessarily have to be a family member, it can be a youth worker, it can be a teacher, a faith leader.\n\n\"If they don't flag it up one thing I can guarantee is it is going to get worse because they are going to be made to be more embroiled in the criminality and it's going to be more difficult to mitigate their role.\"\n\nDet Supt Turner also called on people who think child criminal exploitation is taking place to contact the authorities.\n\n*Anyone with information about those involved in serious and organised crime, including the supply of controlled drugs and use of firearms, can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.\n\n*If you are under-18 and wish to contact the NSPCC for advice, call 0800 1111\n\n*If you are over-18 and are concerned for the welfare of a child, call 0808 800 5000","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
