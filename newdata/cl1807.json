Don't students deserve to be taught by experts?\n\nI got a phone call one morning from the supply agency. The conversation started well: the job was in a secondary school with a good Ofsted rating, only half an hour's drive away. But the recruitment consultant was selling it to me hard. \"Sounds great,\" I said. \"What's the catch?\"\n\n\"I know you're good with technology - that last school said you knew how to use the interactive whiteboard and you even fixed the printer,\" said the recruiter. \"It's ICT and computing.\" I was a little taken aback. Sure, I can put together a nifty PowerPoint with the best of them and my Excel spreadsheets are almost legendary, but I'm a science teacher.\n\nMore and more teachers are being asked to teach subjects they never trained for, and there's also been a rise in schools using completely unqualified teachers. This year, one school I know well is using several members of the school leadership team to fill teaching gaps in ICT and computing. The school has a qualified ICT teacher, but her time is taken up with GCSE groups. Meanwhile, a teacher I know was recently timetabled to teach Spanish alongside their main subject, despite not being able to speak a word. It was only after she complained that the school arranged for someone else - who at least had a rudimentary grasp of the language - to teach the class.\n\nOften it comes down to timetable issues, as pupil numbers increase and budgets are squeezed. And it looks likely that these types of instances will become more frequent, with more gaps appearing when no teachers qualified in that subject are available.\n\nAccording to a 2017 report for the House of Commons Education Committee, the Government has missed its targets for initial teacher (ITT) education [pdf] for the past five years. The report also points out that recruitment in computing missed the target by the biggest margin of all English baccalaureate (EBacc) subjects, with only 68% of ITT places filled. Perhaps this explains why I was asked to teach computing without any experience in the subject.\n\nSurely this is a problem? Would any parent want their child taught Spanish, for instance, by someone who is only able to order food in a Spanish restaurant using a very loud voice and hand signals?\n\nMy own experience teaching a subject I had no training in was a steep learning curve. If it had been history or geography I might have had some idea about the Romans or oxbow lakes. However, this was coding, computer programming, games design and building websites with HTML. I was only ever one step ahead of the students - and I just about got away with it.\n\nIt's not that there aren't benefits to occasionally teaching another subject. It gave me an opportunity to see students in a different light - realising that slightly less academic pupils often thrive when offered technology that supports their writing and research. I saw that some of those who lack confidence writing with pen and paper, or setting up scientific apparatus, turned into experts in writing computer code. And when they struggled, I struggled. I knew first-hand what their misconceptions were, because a lot of the time they were mine too. I empathised when they couldn't remember how to do something.\n\nSo having a teacher who is qualified in a subject other than the one they're teaching isn't always a bad thing. But in an ideal world we might teach outside of our subjects to support professional development rather than for necessity. As more teachers are expected to pick up these classes on a regular basis, to muddle through weekly slots on their timetable, it could be a personal crisis for some of those already working under a great amount of pressure - and a wider crisis for schools and students.\n\nI'm not working in ICT any more, but I still find myself in unfamiliar territory. My current role as a science teacher also comes with maths on the timetable. I had a lot of homework over the holidays.\n\nFollow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach, like us on Facebook, and join the Guardian Teacher Network for lesson resources and the latest articles direct to your inbox\n\nLooking for a teaching job?
