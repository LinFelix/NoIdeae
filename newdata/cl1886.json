To help filmmakers and video professionals create standout content, Adobe will highlight the latest innovations in virtual reality (VR)\/360, animation, motion graphics, editing, collaboration and Adobe Stock -- all available later this year. Many of these features are powered by Adobe Sensei, the company's artificial intelligence and machine learning framework. Adobe will preview these advancements at Stand 7.G27 in the RAI Amsterdam Convention Center and at 140 partner booths from September 15-19 at IBC.\n\n\"Video is the fastest growing medium in communications and entertainment. Whether you're an online creator, global media company or filmmaker, you need to deliver world class content across all platforms and formats at incredible speed,\" said Bryan Lamkin, senior vice president of Digital Media at Adobe. \"Adobe is breaking new ground in collaboration, social sharing and analytics to accelerate workflows for all video creators.\"\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud and Premiere Pro have become the platform of choice for professional editors around the world from Hollywood to Bollywood including high-profile productions: Al Gore's \"An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power\" from co-directors Bonni Cohen and John Shenk, \"Mindhunter\" from executive producer and director David Fincher, \"Only the Brave\" from director Joseph Kosinski, and \"6 Below\" from director Scott Waugh. Media companies are making history by bringing characters to life with Character Animator, such as Mr. Bean on Facebook Live, and through the work of online content creators like Valentina Vee, Jouelzy, Rooster Teeth and Rachel Nguyen.\n\nPowerful Integrated Workflows and Performance Enhancements\n\nThe new capabilities coming later this year to Adobe Creative Cloud for video include:\n\nIntegration with Adobe Stock\n\nAdobe Stock continues to build the most comprehensive creative marketplace with over 90 million assets including photos, illustrations and vectors. Customers now have access to over 4 million HD and 4K Adobe Stock video footage directly within their Creative Cloud video workflows and can now search and scrub assets in Premiere Pro. Coming to this release are hundreds of professionally-created motion graphics templates for Adobe Stock, available later this year, and allow editors to leverage some of the best designed motion graphics. Additionally, motion graphic artists will be able to monetize their work and sell Motion Graphic templates for Premiere Pro through Adobe Stock. Earlier this year, Adobe added editorial and premium collections from Reuters, USA TODAY Sports, Stocksy and 500px. Pond5 collections introduced in April 2017 further expand the premium and video offering.\n\nAdobe Sensei is a framework and set of intelligent services built into the Adobe Cloud Platform which dramatically improve the design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei leverages the company's massive volume of content and data assets, as well as its deep domain expertise in the creative, marketing and document segments, within a unified artificial intelligence\/machine learning framework.
