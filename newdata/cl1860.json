You can also listen to the full episode free on SoundCloud here.\n\nThis week's featured guest on NBR Sunday Business with Andrew Patterson is Paul Cameron co-founder of Booktrack.\n\nBooktrack is an artificial intelligence soundtrack company that allows audio books to be recorded with an accompanying sound track.\n\nThis AI technology is allowing Booktrack to create an entirely new reading experience, allowing writers and creatives to add a synchronised movie style soundtrack - including music, ambient audio and sound effect to a story, with audio paced to each individual's reading speed.\n\nMr Cameron discusses how the business idea was first conceived on Auckland's Devonport ferry and the impact AI is having on Booktrack's growth prospects in the future.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
