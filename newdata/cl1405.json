In the midst of his election campaign in the southern Germany city of Freiburg, Schulz met with DW editor-in-chief Ines Pohl and TV presenter Jaafar Abdul Karim.\n\nSchulz told journalists that the human rights situation in Turkey is bad. \"If you fly to Turkey and make a report, I can't say whether or not you'll be in jail the next day. And that definitely is not consistent with EU principles,\" explained the SPD leader.\n\nHe went to say that it makes little sense to speak to President Erdogan at the moment. During his election campaign, Schulz has often stated that he advocates the termination of EU accession talks with the government in Ankara. And if need be, he also would also cancel the EU-Turkey refugee deal. \"But I am not prepared to get down on my knees in front of Erdogan. We cannot allow ourselves to be blackmailed,\" he declared.\n\nIf he becomes chancellor, Schulz does not want to beat around the bush about refugee policy and plans some tough talk with EU countries that refuse to accept refugees. The SPD chancellor has openly threatened to deny EU funding to countries like Hungary and Poland. In the next seven years, some 900 billion euros in EU funds will be available for transfer to different EU members. \"That is why I believe that during the finance talks we will tell countries like Poland or Hungary, who receive large payments from the EU budget, that solidarity isn't like cherry picking but is a principal. Either we show solidarity in all issues or we forget the whole thing,\" he said.\n\nSchulz would like to implement a European immigration law with fixed immigration quotas, while maintaining the existing right to asylum. He also explained the necessity to cooperate with African nations, saying, \"In order to stop human traffickers we must, if need be, work together with countries like Niger or others. That is only possible under the supervision of international organizations, because constitutional norms must be adhered to and there is at least a risk of some nations not being able to follow international legal norms.\"\n\nA few days before the election, Schulz is clearly trailing behind Chancellor Merkel and her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in most polls. Nevertheless, he does not want to give up and continues to attack the chancellor. He argues that, \"Angela Merkel manages Germany's status quo according to the motto 'a country in which we live well and enjoy living.' She is right. We do live well and enjoy living in this country. But we also want life to be good tomorrow, and that is why we need to tell the people which course we are taking.\"\n\n\"Would have given a televised speech.\"\n\nMany people are uncertain about the country's future, including a great part of the middle class. Schulz said that had he been chancellor at the height of the refugee crisis two years ago, for example, he would have addressed German citizens in a televised speech to explain his actions in order to avoid misinterpretations. He also said that politicians nowadays generally do not have the courage to tell people that nothing will stay the same in today's rapidly changing world. Schulz cited examples in Europe, like Brexit supporters, Italy's Grillo followers or the Front National in France. What these movements all have in common in Schulz's opinion is the fact that they have managed to gain the support of angry citizens who are frustrated with a drastically changing world.\n\nLow popularity ratings vs inner equilibrium\n\nWhen asked whether he was disappointed with his seemingly hopeless parliamentary election campaign, Schulz responded, \"No, sorry, I'll have to disappoint you there. When I open the morning paper and the polls are favorable I am happy. If I open the paper and the polls are bad, I am not happy. But throughout my life I have had my share of ups and downs. My inner equilibrium tells me polls are just polls. The people will speak on September 24th. And then we'll see.\"\n\nRead more: SPD voters hopeful despite new low in German election polls\n\nAnd which top politician from another political party would the SPD leader take with him to a deserted island? Schulz didn't have to think long: he would chose the head of the Green Party, Cem Özdemir. \"I know him the best; he was with me in European Parliament. He's a fine person.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
