They should do more to find effective ways to resume dialogue and negotiation,\" he said.\nPresident Donald Trump and others in the United States and beyond have urged China to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on its Communist ally to help resolve the standoff over North Korea's weapons programmes.\nChina fought alongside North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War, in which Chinese leader Mao Zedong lost his eldest son, and Beijing has long been Pyongyang's chief ally and primary trade partner.\nBut the Chinese government has pushed back against the notion that it has any control over Pyongyang, and says it is the United States that should be doing more.\nTrump tweeted earlier this month that the United States was considering halting trade with countries doing business with North Korea.\nCui on Friday cautioned against putting China-U.S. trade on the table.\n\"Efforts to undermine Sino-U.S. trade, or even slapping sanctions on China, I think would be off-target,\" the Chinese state news agency Xinhua quoted Cui as saying on Friday at a Chinese National Day reception.\n\"If someone were to pressure China or impose sanctions on China over the DPRK, it would not be supported by many U.S. citizens,\" Cui said, referring to North Korea by the acronym for its official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\"Workers at U.S. airplane factories, farmers growing soybeans, companies that sell smartphones to China, manufacturers that enjoy large market shares in China, companies in the service sector that have gained trade surplus in China, U.S. states that engage in robust trade with China would all stand against it,\" Xinhua quoted him as saying. \n\n (Reporting by David Brunnstrom in WASHINGTON and John Ruwitch in SHANGHAI; Writing by Eric Walsh;
