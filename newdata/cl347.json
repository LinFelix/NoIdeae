The Nasdaq set\nan intraday record on a jump in technology shares.\nBrent oil prices, the global benchmark, held near five-month\nhighs and posted their biggest weekly gain since late July.\nForecasts for rising demand and the gradual restart of U.S. oil\nrefineries after Hurricane Harvey pushed up prices.\nGold fell after a European Central Bank official called for\nscaling back the bank's stimulus program. Losses were capped\nwhen weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales renewed doubts the\nFederal Reserve will raise rates in December.\nYields on longer-dated U.S. Treasury maturities briefly\nadded to earlier declines after the weak data revived some\nconcerns about slower economic growth in the third quarter and\nthe possibility of a Fed rate hike.\nInterest rates are lower than at the beginning of the year,\nmaking stocks more attractive as does a back-drop of a growing\nglobal economy, said Rahul Shah, chief executive of Ideal Asset\nManagement in New York.\n\"We made it through the summer without a significant\ncorrection. As we head into earnings season, there's a potential\nfor the market to go even higher,\" Shah said.\nSome of the big tech companies that form a large part of the\nindexes offer above-average growth at reasonable valuations, he\nsaid. Any dip in the equity market because of North Korean\nmissile tests offer investors a buying opportunity, he said.\n\"They tend to talk loud with their threats,\" Shah said about\nNorth Korea. \"But in terms of the actual commission of those\nthreats, I don't think it's destabilizing to the market.\"\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe\ngained 0.11 percent to set a new high for an index that tracks\nthe performance of more than 2,400 stocks in 47 countries.\nJapan's Nikkei closed 0.5 percent higher and a more\nthan 3 percent jump for the week was its weekly performance\nsince November\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose\n64.86 points, or 0.29 percent, to 22,268.34. The S&amp;P 500\ngained 4.61 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,500.23 and the Nasdaq\nComposite added 19.38 points, or 0.3 percent, to\n6,448.47.\nFor the week, the Dow gained 2.16 percent, the S&amp;P 500 added\n1.58 percent and the Nasdaq 1.39 percent.\nThe tech sector was boosted by Nvidia's 6.3 percent\njump to a record high after Evercore ISI raised its price target\non the stock.\nThe S&amp;P 500 technology index has been the best\nperforming sector this year, rising 26 percent and far outpacing\nthe broader S&amp;P 500's 11.7 percent gain.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading\nregional shares lost 0.41 percent to close at 1,495.38.\nU.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in August as Hurricane\nHarvey likely depressed motor vehicle purchases, dropping 0.2\npercent last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast\nretail sales nudging up 0.1 percent.\nThe disappointing U.S. data, which included industrial\noutput in August, came after a report that showed the strongest\nincrease in consumer prices in seven months.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were\nlittle changed in price to yield 2.2005 percent.\nA eurozone government bond selloff resumed after hawkish\nrhetoric from a Bank of England policymaker bolstered the notion\nthat central banks across the developed world are moving into\ntightening mode.\nGerman Bunds fell 1 basis points in price to\nyield 0.433 percent.\nBrent oil prices, the global benchmark, held near five-month\nhighs and posted their biggest weekly gain since late July.\nU.S. crude settled unchanged at $49.89 per barrel\nand Brent rose 15 cents to settle at $55.51 a barrel.\nThe dollar index fell 0.39 percent, while the euro\nrose 0.33 percent to $1.1957. The Japanese yen weakened\n0.56 percent against the greenback at 110.86 per dollar and\nsterling traded at $1.3591, up 1.46 percent on the day.\nU.S. gold futures for December delivery settled down\n0.3 percent at $1,325.20.\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Nick Zieminski and David\nGregorio)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 10:37:55.118"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 10:37:54.451","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|rG39TvvusoIMkONxITaU\/43Hi4k=|aXYo3f2VurzoIzjvdZDxvwq5eN02GO\/\/Esp1QEnbxy4jnSz8UL7+Zg==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":1,"name":"Business_Finance"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/412d2c87-2ead-391a-ae44-6add965d8ada","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Economy","importance":"1","originalValue":"Economy"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/f40bff98-3ea4-371e-88bd-a5d02482466b","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Dow Jones & Company","importance":"1","originalValue":"Dow Jones & Company"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/b82fa4a1-1d29-386e-a327-103788618023","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Dow Jones Industrial Average","importance":"1","originalValue":"Dow Jones Industrial Average"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/9efd0bee-0479-336f-a246-d987f6406804","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Business","importance":"2","originalValue":"Business"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/06fb4dfb-0f17-320f-a936-8a3d8807cef9","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Stock market","importance":"2","originalValue":"Stock market"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/fee1cc69-1062-349a-9c92-a5cbb369da4a","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Price of oil","importance":"2","originalValue":"Price of oil"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/7":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/7","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/6177ba17-5322-3e10-bdc3-d8e68df96774","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"World oil market chronology from","importance":"2","originalValue":"World oil market chronology from 2003"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/8":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/SocialTag\/8","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/de871897-6006-3e5c-bcd7-55e36540d5dc","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Economic consequences of the 2006 Thai coup d'état","importance":"2","originalValue":"Economic consequences of the 2006 Thai coup d'état"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/f5aaf050-b96c-32c0-adc7-f65ffb9a8562\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Professional Information Services -
