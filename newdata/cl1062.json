The top in question is a feminist design with ties to Planned Parenthood, and it didn't take long for the controversy to gain speed on the internet, with a viral spreading of the news.\n\nFemale-owned agency Word is selling what they call \"The Creator Shirt.\" Their original creation features the word \"woman\" written in nine different languages. On their website, they write that the shirt is meant \"to represent our belief that feminism and human right should be intersectional. Women from all races, cultures, religions, and economic backgrounds deserve access to safe medical care.\" Furthermore, the shirt was created for a good cause, as 25% of the proceeds from the sale of each T-shirt are being donated to Planned Parenthood. We reached out to Forever 21 for comment, and they released the following statement: \"The shirt in question was bought from a third party source. As soon as Forever 21 was alerted to the issue, we respectfully removed it from our website. Because this product did not have trademark or IP protections, there were no red flags raised at the time of purchase.\"\n\nForever 21 is no stranger to the claim of stolen designs, whether from large fashion houses, like Gucci, who bring major lawsuits against the brand or small indie designers who appeal to their social media following to spread awareness. Word agency took the latter approach, posting a plea to Instagram, calling for action. With a side-by-side image of the two tops, Word writes, \"Please share: Hey @forever21, we're not ones to point fingers but this looks mighty familiar. For the record, we created this shirt with a purpose. Too bad they removed the Swahili, Arabic, Hebrew & Japanese. Donate all the money to @plannedparenthood.\"\n\nTo buy Word's original creation (and donate some money to Planned Parenhood!), you can shop \"The Creator Shirt\" here for $25.\n\nWe have reached out to Word Agency about the controversy but have yet to hear back. Check back for updates.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 19:25:28.068"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 19:25:27.668","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|V8HtZr0nYws7+WtzlrRFtxCupq8=|b7\/3x\/Vk0wyEjBKXG2DxdRjFLL5os8a+TXoCD\/hl1Ufigtt1LgP2Gg==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/dd2ed72e-e65e-32dc-b67a-d70465e9ca71\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/dd2ed72e-e65e-32dc-b67a-d70465e9ca71\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/dd2ed72e-e65e-32dc-b67a-d70465e9ca71\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/d10f5456-73c1-37ee-932b-82186e09167a","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Parenthood","importance":"1","originalValue":"Parenthood (2010 TV series)"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/dd2ed72e-e65e-32dc-b67a-d70465e9ca71\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/dd2ed72e-e65e-32dc-b67a-d70465e9ca71\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/bfe0482a-5462-3aaf-a05b-f5f76713429e","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Microsoft Word","importance":"1","originalValue":"Microsoft Word"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/dd2ed72e-e65e-32dc-b67a-d70465e9ca71\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/dd2ed72e-e65e-32dc-b67a-d70465e9ca71\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/3dd160c1-2ca0-3913-8fe9-4dca175b0bee","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Application software","importance":"1","originalValue":"Application software"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/dd2ed72e-e65e-32dc-b67a-d70465e9ca71\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/dd2ed72e-e65e-32dc-b67a-d70465e9ca71\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/16293516-a848-3162-8f98-a310581b027d","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Software","importance":"2","originalValue":"Software"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/dd2ed72e-e65e-32dc-b67a-d70465e9ca71\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/dd2ed72e-e65e-32dc-b67a-d70465e9ca71\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/fc84e4a4-03bc-3ced-b42a-682809ef96dc","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Writing","importance":"2","originalValue":"Writing"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/dd2ed72e-e65e-32dc-b67a-d70465e9ca71\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Software -
