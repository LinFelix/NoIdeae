That's what gets me out of bed.\"\n\nGet What's On updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nSchool didn't really suit Ben Hinchliffe-Lowe.\n\nBored and uninspired by the education system, he went straight into work at 17-years-old.\n\n\"I didn't enjoy sitting in the classroom, writing dates... I only just got into college, but sacked that off after the first year.\"\n\n\"I started working as a mechanic for 11 months in Blackburn. I screwed about quite a bit... got laid off. Then I was in warehouses, a sewing machinist, roofing, carpentry, any job I could get really - even if it was part time.\"\n\nAs someone who preferred being hands-on, he had at least found an avenue which suited him, but his arthritis meant that doing such physically demanding jobs were much more difficult for him, and he had yet to find one where he would settle.\n\nThat was, until he was offered a job at the Eagle and Child in Ramsbottom. Or more specifically, one of the pub's pop up events.\n\n\"The job centre gave me a choice: pop up restaurant or cleaning. I took the pop up. And 18 months later I'm still here.\"\n\n\"When I started in the pop-up I had no sense of taste, no sense of smell, wasn't interested in cooking or participating. I just turned up so I could get my job seekers.\n\n\"I've gone from there to having a decent sense of taste, and I'm relatively good at cooking dishes. All the customers seem to think it's fantastic.\"\n\nAs well as boosting Ben's cooking skills, the job has also lifted his self esteem, although as part of a multi-award winning kitchen team, he's still incredibly modest.\n\n\"I hate sitting at home and getting paid for it. I prefer to work, to earn my money, you feel like you enjoy it more - if you go cinema, you feel like you've earned it.\"\n\n\"My Mum and Dad are proud, and my sister is, because before this I was in a bad way. My friends don't understand why I do it, because I've gone from seeing them fairly often to not seeing anyone outside my family. I was in a bad way: a lot of debt, a lot of issues.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old went from pop-up to a full time job at the Eagle and Child, working as a commis chef in their reputable kitchen. He's starting to help with creating new dishes for the menus, using ingredients which are sourced locally - some are even grown in an allotment in the beer garden.\n\nThe pop-up that first hired Ben was just one of the projects run by pub boss Glen Duckett - a man on a mission to recruit and train marginalised and unemployed young people in order to regenerate towns and communities.\n\nOriginally from Accrington, Duckett has a history of working in regeneration across the UK, doing everything from youth justice at Gateshead Council to working with disadvantaged communities with Groundwork, a charity that helps improve public spaces.\n\nHospitality is another string to his bow, having cooked at Delia Smith's brasserie at Norwich City FC.\n\nSix years ago, he returned to his home turf to weave all his experiences together, and took on the Eagle and Child, a pub which had been empty for 18 months.\n\n\"The idea was to look at taking a boarded up pub - because pubs were closing at the time too - creating a community pub with a family offer, and at the same time train up young people\n\n\"We focused on young people from the most marginalised areas - young offenders, disabled people, young carers and parents, young people leaving care, and those recovering with mental health, drug and alcohol dependence.\"\n\nSo far, the business has employed more than 100 young people, with more than 75% progressing onto a further career in hospitality.\n\n\"You do change people's lives, and it is rewarding. That's what gets me out of bed.\"\n\nThe work falls under Duckett's social enterprise EAT Pennines, which runs establishments aimed at delivering quality food and drink while providing training and employment for young people. These include Eagle and Child, EAT DRINK SHOP, a horticulture centre in Heaton Park, and private canteens in Didsbury.\n\n\"My big passion about regeneration is that we must start with young people , because they're the ones that are going to make a difference in their communities\n\n\"You can change the culture in those communities and get young people to aspire to have a job and an income, rather than just do what their parents and grandparents have done and just go on the dole. Then you can change communities.\n\n\"Getting a wage is really good for their self esteem, as other employers wouldn't look at them because they think 'I'm not going to get the same level of efficiency', or maybe they wouldn't know how to treat them. You just have to treat everybody as an individual.\n\n\"Communities are diverse, and all businesses should try and give something back. It's getting people off benefits by giving them a chance, and helping people to become economically active in the way that fits in their capabilities.\"\n\nBut even with all their social objectives, Duckett doesn't let his standards slip. The Eagle and Child recently scooped best pub at the Great British Pub Awards - proving that it's possible to meet ethical objectives, while serving accomplished food and drink.\n\nIt also won the Observer Food Monthly's Best Sunday Lunch in 2013 and was voted Best Food Pub at the Manchester Food and Drink Awards in both 2014 and 2016.\n\nThe food is unashamedly modern British. Bold, gutsy dishes such as Forest of Bowland hogget, beef dripping chips, and Lancashire cheeses have built up the pub's reputation as a serious foodie destination under head chef Alex Shaw.\n\nTheir success is, in part, down to the thorough training they provide - from Level One in Hospitality and Catering right through to degree level equivalents.\n\n\"I've got one young lad who took four years to do a level one apprenticeship,\" says Glenn. \"We supported him all the way until he finally achieved, but he's such a great worker.\n\n\"Because of his autism, he's very systematic in how he works, so he always follows the standards that have been set he doesn't try and cut corners.\n\n\"I often use him as an example to other staff, he might take a few minutes longer, but he does them to my standard. I've just promoted him to floor supervisor - he's in charge of making sure everything runs effectively.\"\n\nAnd the wider benefits of the project can't be understated. Training and employment doesn't just help that one individual, it can help secure the future of an entire community, says Duckett.\n\n\"There's no point in being a super-rich person and living in a community where nobody else works, you're just living in deprivation yourself really,\" he says.\n\n\"But if I live in a community that I support, I live in a better place. It's about sustainability.\"\n\nBut before you impact the wider community, it all starts with the individual. For Ben, the focus is just on finishing his level three in hospitality.\n\n\"The next step is junior sous, which I'm hoping to get sometime next year. It's difficult, but its fun.\n\n\"It's in the graft now - no more messing around. They offered me the apprenticeship and gave me the chance, which I'm thankful for.\n\n\"If I didn't have this job I'd probably be in a warehouse, freezing cold, with about eight jumpers on and a bad back.\"\n\n\"Instead I get to sit in a nice warm kitchen...with a just fairly bad back.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
