It was developed by Birmingham, Ala.-based LIV Development.\n\nCompleted in 2017, the three-story apartment community features eight buildings with 296 one-, two-and three-bedroom units. Located 15 miles from Charlotte, the community features such amenities including a swimming pool, an athletic club, bike sharing, high-speed Internet, and garages.\n\nFor Summer Chase Apartments, $3.6 million in joint venture equity and a $12.8 million Fannie Mae acquisition loan were used by a private investor to acquire the multifamily property, which is in North Myrtle Beach, S.C.\n\nBuilt in 2001, the gated, garden-style community includes 168 apartment units and is near Highway 17 Business. Common amenities include video surveillance, a clubhouse with Wi-Fi, a swimming pool, a 24-hour fitness center, laundry facilities, a playground and a grilling area.\n\nThe deals were all closed with the assistance of Bellwether Enterprise's newly formed Equity Products Division. The debt for the two deals were arranged respectively by Cooper Willis, executive vice president, and Ridge Stafford, senior vice president in Bellwether Enterprise's Charlotte
