We won't be stopping.\"\nThe office of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra,\nwhich defended the law, had no immediate comment.\nIn January 2015, U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson in Los\nAngeles agreed with the law's opponents that the federal Poultry\nProducts Inspection Act preempted it.\nBut in Friday's decision, Circuit Judge Jacqueline Nguyen\nsaid California was simply trying to ban a feeding method it\ndeemed cruel and inhumane.\nShe said this posed no conflict with the federal law, even\nif it effectively banned foie gras in the state.\n\"Nothing in the federal law or its implementing regulations\nlimits a state's ability to regulate the types of poultry that\nmay be sold for human consumption,\" Nguyen wrote.\nJared Goodman, a lawyer for People for the Ethical Treatment\nof Animals, said the decision \"prohibits selling diseased livers\nof birds force-fed by jamming tubes down their throat and\npumping concentrated food down their esophagus. This is truly\ntorture and unimaginable cruelty.\"\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Richard Leong in New York,\nand Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and\nDiane
