It was 2 February 2009 and Helen's friends had encouraged her to look into becoming a foster parent. She considered the possibility but she didn't think she had the time, not to mention she already had four kids of her own with her husband Victor.\n\nSo when she picked up the phone that day, she knew she was going to tell the foster home \"No, I can't do it.\" And that's exactly what she said.\n\nBut the woman on the other end of the phone wouldn't accept that answer. She had just learned of a tragic incident that left two sisters, Stephanie and Laura, in foster care.\n\nThe sisters' mother, who was from Nigeria but lived in Dublin where her daughters were born, had collapsed in the shower and was rushed to the hospital.\n\nTheir father had already walked out on the family. His name isn't even on Laura's birth certificate. The girls had nowhere else to go.\n\n\"This is your opportunity,\" the woman from the foster home told Helen.\n\nHelen and Victor had gone through a long interview process to be able to become foster parents, but when opportunities had arisen previously, they had decided against it each time.\n\nThis time, however, the circumstances were different. Helen was urged to take in Stephanie and Laura, aged five and three at the time. It was only for a week, until their mother got out of the hospital, the foster home insisted. And it just so happened that Helen was on holiday for that week. \"It was perfect timing,\" Helen recalls on her agreeing to take the girls in.\n\nThat one week as agreed upon soon turned into two, then a month. Stephanie and Laura's mother hadn't left the hospital and it looked like she wouldn't anytime soon. It had been determined that the reason for her collapse in the shower was cancer, and the outlook was bleak.\n\nThe girls never did end up leaving their home with Helen, Victor and the family. Their mother passed away in June 2009, four months after they had moved in with the Bolsters.\n\nIt's been almost nine years since Stephanie and Laura become a part of the Bolster family. They just recently returned from holiday in Turkey, where they go every summer to unwind. This time, though, was different: it was the first without Victor, whom the sisters had come to call 'Dad', as he passed away in December.\n\n\"These girls have had a hard life,\" Helen says. \"They watched their mother die of cancer, their father walk out on them, and then for my husband to die, it's been hard. If I didn't have these two girls [and my birth children], I'd be absolutely lost.\"\n\nUsually, the family holiday would last for the whole summer, but this time it was only for a month. Turkey reminded the family of all the memories shared with Victor, but it is also where Laura got her start in athletics - a career already well decorated, even at the age of 12.\n\nFour years ago in Turkey, Laura's athletics career started with a simple challenge. Her mum had sent her to get something from the store, and a boy there her age said he could beat her in a race. The boy was wrong. Laura breezed passed him first, then as others saw and wanted to try their hand, she beat them too.\n\n\"People came up to me and told me what had happened,\" says Helen. \"I was shocked. I knew I just had to get her into an athletics club.\"\n\nLaura was quickly enrolled in a local club and has never looked back on her way to competing at national level for Ireland.\n\nBut more opportunities lie across the Irish Sea in the UK, where two of Helen's three biological children now live (the other is in Australia). Sadly none of them mean a connection with her blood relations.\n\nWhen a call came from a biological aunt who was \"dying\" to meet up in London, Helen thought it would be a good idea for Laura and her sister to meet someone related to them, and who knew their immediate family.\n\nThe trip had been planned out for months, but on the morning the girls were supposed to meet their aunt, she called with a brief message: \"I got called into work today so I won't be able to meet up. Sorry.\" Months of anticipation vanished in a phone call that lasted less than a minute.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 19:33:38.117"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 19:33:37.352","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|1vrQ0G\/Q3Z9PUIQwU+CrLV7onIY=|bQZI4dXJGg7bd0tvEMzq4Fbmji2L1nsriUNY0zDRc6Fh694OJpFNVg==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d4444af1-faa0-3095-9239-a87fab3cebdb\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d4444af1-faa0-3095-9239-a87fab3cebdb\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d4444af1-faa0-3095-9239-a87fab3cebdb\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/8608ef27-4371-3c3a-9d07-adc6bd6cdf84","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Laura Spencer","importance":"1","originalValue":"Laura Spencer (General Hospital)"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d4444af1-faa0-3095-9239-a87fab3cebdb\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Home Furnishings Retailers -
