Children's and Women's hospitals redevelopment, in one of the baby-parent rooms at the new neonatal intensive-care unit.\n\nHigh technology equipment has made a huge difference in the survivalÂ of the frailest and tiniest of premature babies. But the latest evidence shows that having the proper environment in neonatal intensive care units and lots of old-fashioned skin-to-skin contact between parents and babies provide myriad health benefits for both.\n\nSo in the state-of-the-art neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU, that opens next month in the new Teck Acute Care Centre on the campus of B.C. Childrenâs and Womenâs hospitals, parents will be given every opportunity to bond intimately with their babies. Thatâs because parents with a baby in intensive care will now be able to sleep in spacious, quiet, spa-like rooms next to their babyâs incubator, even when babies are born at the threshold of viability, as early as 22 weeks into the usual 40-week pregnancy.Â\n\nPremature and sick babies have traditionally been deprived of constant contact with their parents because the conventional design of such intensive care units is a central nursery in which incubators are lined up in rows, offering no privacy or space for visiting parents, not to mention being less than conducive to breastfeeding and cuddling.\n\nWhile fragile infants in the new single-occupancy NICU suites will still spend much of their time cocooned in $70,000 incubators, the new style of care creates favourable conditions for ideal baby development and parental bonding. It is expected to reduce infections, improve sleep, decrease the length of hospital stays and reduce hospital readmissions, among other benefits.\n\nAnd in a precedent-setting model of care, some mothers who have just given birth at B.C. Womenâs Hospital â\" even those who have had a caesarean section â\" will not only share a room with their babies, they will also receive their postpartum care from the same nurse assigned to their fragile infants. The NICU mom and baby co-sharing of a room and a nurse is being called a âflagship initiative'â â\" a North American first of its kind care model that will be rolled out gradually in up to 12 of the 70 NICU suites (The other 58 are designed for mothers who donât need medical care to live with their babies).\n\nBefore committing to mothers and babies sharing rooms, the hospital renovated space in the old NICU to conduct an experiment in what a mom and baby sharing a room might be like. Seven months ago, when her baby Elijah was born six weeks prematurely, Amanda Lockitch was one of the first new moms to participate in the room-sharing trial.\n\nâI would have been discharged a day or two after delivering him, but I heard about this trial and I wrangled one of the rooms so I could be with my baby the whole time he was in the NICU,â Lockitch said. They were there for 10 days.\n\nâI felt like I got a good crash course in neonatal care from the nurses. My baby had a feeding tube and was under the lights because he was jaundiced but other than that he was healthy.â","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
