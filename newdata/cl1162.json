In the event of Yunyi Guokai's shares being sold in their entirety at that price, Lai and his fellow investors would be in line to make a profit of more than £50m.\n\nAlthough the interest has come to nothing, the fact that the Baggies' owners were willing to initially engage is of interest.\n\nTony Pulis' men have made a strong start to the season and currently sit ninth in the table\n\nWhile any motivation to sell could be based on the potentially impressive return on his investment, there are also politics at play.\n\nLast month, China's state council formally placed sports clubs on a widening list of overseas industries in which Chinese investment is restricted - alongside property, film, hotels and entertainment - in an effort to limit 'irrational' spending on projects outside the country.\n\nWhile such investment is not banned, companies interest in acquiring a slice of Europe's football pie face significantly more substantial checks and balances from state regulators than before.\n\nThe situation is tense, with investors not wanting to be seen to be acting against the wishes of the state, while Chinese owners wishing to inject money into their clubs will now find themselves having to jump through loopholes to do so.\n\nThis perfect storm, plus the possible profit margins on offer through a quick sale, could give Chinese investors across Europe encouragement to sell up.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
