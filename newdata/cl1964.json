No one is above the law.\n\n\"Therefore, for anyone who chooses to deliberately stoke the fire of discord and threaten the unity and security of the country, as chief law officers, it is our responsibility to ensure that the full weight of the law is brought to bear on such persons.\n\n\"Your capacity to do so with respect to the offences created by the Acts of National Assembly has been strengthened by the fiat I recently gave to all state attorneys-general to prosecute all federal offences on behalf of the attorney-general of the federation. I urge you to put the fiat to work and ensure that hate speeches are nipped in the bud.\"\n\nMr. Malami thanked the Adamawa Government, UNHCR and UNFPA for supporting the meeting on gender-based violence saying that the meeting would consider bills on the issue that would serve as a model for various states to adopt.\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Muhammadu Bindow of Adamawa State said that the state government would support any meaningful judicial and justice reform for the interest of the people.\n\nMr. Bindow said that one of the cardinal aspects of his administration was to ensure peace, unity and stability among the diverse communities irrespective of their religious, tribal or sectional differences.\n\nAttorneys-General attending the two-day seminar are also to review some aspects of the National Prosecution Policy, Code of Conduct and Guidelines for Prosecutors.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
