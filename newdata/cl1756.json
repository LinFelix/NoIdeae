She entered Saturday already owning the state's top time this season in 18:31.76.\n\nThe two-day meet, the oldest in the state, featured more than 5,000 runners from more than 100 schools from 10 states.\n\nTRINITY INVITATIONAL\n\nTop-seeded Dustin Horter, a Lakota (Ohio) East senior, definitely didn't disappoint, winning in 15:02.3 for the sixth-fastest time in meet history. It wasn't Horter's quickest time of the year - he has a 14:56 to his credit - but the country's No. 9 runner in the Flo50 still won by nearly 20 seconds. Florida's Trevor Foley, who owned a 0.6-second lead over Horter at the 2,500-meter mark, was the runner-up in 15:21.1.\n\nHoly Cross junior Keeton Thornsberry, who entered Saturday with the third-best time in the state, was ninth in 15:44.4 to improve his previous season-best time by more than 7 seconds.\n\nEastern senior Sam Ackerman also had a solid day by placing 14th and lowering his season-best time by more than 15 seconds to 15:53 even.\n\nTrinity senior Trevor Warren, who entered Saturday with the state's best season time of 15:28.89 in last month's Tiger Run, was 17th in 15:55.3.\n\nSt. Xavier won its second straight team title, and third in the last six years, with 35 points to runner-up Trinity's 67 points.\n\n\"I thought we ran pretty well, but I don't think it was our best race,\" said St. Xavier coach Chuck Medley. \"We had a tough week of practice and there were some guys that we beat last time that we didn't beat this time - and we've got to get 'em back. But I'm excited because we're coming along about the way I want them to.\"\n\nOut-of-state visitor Marist was third with 87, while Ackerman's Eagles were fourth with 100 points.\n\nCarmel, ranked No. 1 in Indiana and No. 7 in the Flo50, had 49 points to win the team title in the 13-school Midwest Division. Another St. Xavier, this one from Ohio, was the runner-up with 101 points.\n\nVALKYRIE INVITATIONAL\n\nChampion Morgan Gigandet, a senior from Troy (Ohio), led from nearly wire to wire to post the sixth-fastest time in meet history in 17:41.4. Lebanon (Ohio) freshman Faith Duncan, who was within a second of Gigandet at the halfway mark, was the runner-up in 17:58.3 and was the only other girl to break the 18-minute barrier. Carmel sophomore Phoebe Bates, who had a 17:39 earlier this month, was third in 18:04.6.\n\nSapienza-Wright, who left before the awards ceremony, because she was on her way to an official visit to D-I Cornell of the Ivy League, led Manual to a third-place finish in the seven-team Southeast Division with 83 points.\n\n\"They ran great and I was very pleased, because it was a little bit humid today,\" said Manual coach Tim Holman.\n\nCardinal Gibbons was the Southeast champion with 54 points, while Lee's Summit West was the runner-up at 59, and Ravenwood was fourth at 107.\n\nAssumption (fifth, 115 points) and Daviess County (seventh, 123) also represented Kentucky. Daviess County junior Karlee Hoffman, who entered Saturday with the state's second-best time at 18:57.81, was 15th in 18:51.5.\n\nHoffman will fall to third in the state rankings, though, as Manual senior Kathleen Simms was 14th on Saturday in a season-best time of 18:49.9.\n\n\"I felt like both of them ran smart and under control,\" Holman said of his duo of Sapienza-Wright and Simms. \"But it's difficult running with this many talented girls. So I'm very pleased.\"\n\nWhile Sapienza-Wright and Simms have both had better placings this year, Holman said they should not get too caught up in what color ribbons or medals they earned because of the strength and sheer size of the field they were up against.\n\n\"It's invaluable and it's great that it's right in our own back yard, because usually we have to get in the car and drive four or five hours to get competition like this,\" Holman said. \"Getting your tailed kicked can be a very good thing, especially early in the season.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
