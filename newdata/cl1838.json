Portfolio School has been designed to look and operate more like the workplace of the future than the classroom of today, but no one expected students to internalize that approach quite so literally.\n\n\"They view themselves as working,\" says Leibowitz, who has a doctorate in education. \"They're never learning something because one day they'll need it, they're learning something because they need it right now.\"\n\nAs in a modern office, a typical day at Portfolio School revolves around individualized goals and collaborative, interdisciplinary projects. Tiana's ice cream machine was the culmination of a unit called \"learning is delicious,\" which ran the course of the fall 2017 semester. As students explored that theme and built their machines, they learned about science (states of matter), math (measurement), and history (the commercialization of ice). When I first visited the school one morning last October, Tiana had just produced a trial batch of mint ice cream and proudly shared a bowl with me.\n\n\"I made it,\" she said as I sampled a spoonful, green leaves and all.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
