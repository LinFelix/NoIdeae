A third source also confirmed\nCooper, currently deputy economy minister, was being considered.\nThe sources spoke on condition of anonymity because a final\ndecision had not been made.\nEarly on Friday, the opposition-ruled Congress voted 77-22\nto dismiss Kuczynski's Cabinet in a motion of no-confidence,\ndeepening a political standoff that could lead to new\nlegislative elections if lawmakers reject the next cabinet.\nThe crisis forced Kuczynski to cancel his trip to New York\nCity, where he planned to dine with U.S. President Donald Trump\nand deliver a speech at the United Nations General Assembly. It\nalso threatens to stifle a nascent economic recovery in the\nworld's No.2 copper producer following a sharp slowdown early\nthis year.\nAccusing the opposition of undermining his policies,\nespecially on education, Kuczynski told Peruvians in a televised\nspeech that he would keep working to better their lives.\n\"That's the mandate I have until July 28, 2021 and I won't\nretreat one millimeter in that goal,\" said Kuczynski, a former\nWall Street banker who narrowly won last year's election.\nKuczynski did not announce any cabinet appointments.\nWhile he cannot rename outgoing Prime Minister Fernando\nZavala as prime minister, Kuczynski can reappoint other cabinet\nmembers. Zavala, who faced criticism that he was too much of a\ntechnocrat, has doubled as finance minister since Congress\nousted the previous finance minister in June.\nLawmakers with the opposition party Popular Force warned\nKuczynski not to fill his cabinet with old faces. The rightwing\npopulist party has a majority in Congress and is led by\nKuczynski's defeated electoral rival, Keiko Fujimori, the eldest\ndaughter of jailed former autocratic president Alberto Fujimori.\n\nAppointing Vizcarra, a former governor of a mining region,\ncould gratify lawmakers who have called for a cabinet with more\npolitical experience.\nBut it might also anger Popular Force after the party\npressured Vizcarra to resign as transportation minister over a\nproposed change to an airport contract. Cooper was also\ncriticized by the opposition in the controversy.\nNew legislative elections might provide an opening for\nanti-establishment parties with support for Kuczynski's\ngovernment and Congress falling in opinion polls.\nDespite the sparring, Kuczynski and Fujimori both support\nfree-market economic policies.\nCentral Bank President Julio Velarde made a rare plea for\npoliticians to refrain from fueling tensions further. \"I hope\nthat doesn't happen. We're talking about adults, aren't we?\"\nVelarde told reporters at an event Friday.\n(Additional Reporting By Teresa Cespedes and Ursula Scollo,\nEditing by Jonathan Oatis and Mary Milliken)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
