Patoranking is the latest Nigerian colleague to lash out at Mr Eazi for dare saying he brought the Ghanaian influence on the Nigerian music scene.\n\nIn a recent interview on Cool FM Lagos 'Girlie O' crooner talked about his venture to Ghana in search of greener pastures and also weighed in on the influence of Ghanaian sound on Nigerian music.\n\nPatoranking said, \"Nigerians are very powerful people and if they like your song, you are likely to be a success in Africa. There was a point in my life that I travelled to Ghana in search of greener pastures but I ended up trekking and sleeping on the streets. I decided to come back to Nigeria. Then I released 'Alubarika' and 'Girlie O.' Both songs were a hit and in no time, I was invited to perform in Ghana, Kumasi Stadium to be precise. When they came to pick me, I counted the number of cars and it was 13. I was very surprised but was grateful to God.\"\n\nHe also disagreed on Mr Eazi's claim of introducing Nigerians to the Ghanaian sound.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
