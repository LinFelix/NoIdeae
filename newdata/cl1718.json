The five-member board has four vacancies. With a three-member quorum required, it can't take official actions, and without a chairman since last year it cannot hire staff.\n\nTrump nominated a new chairman to the privacy board last month, but the Senate has not acted and the White House has not yet moved to fill the remaining three board vacancies.\n\nAnother likely topic is the effect of a January executive order in which Trump declares that protections outlined in the Privacy Act of 1964 do not apply to foreigners. There's debate about what that means for Europe, as the 2015 Judicial Redress Act says Privacy Act protections do apply to European Union citizens.\n\nNeema Singh Guliani of the American Civil Liberties Union said there's concern about whether non-citizens living in Europe are protected and whether the Judicial Redress Act actually offers the same protections that Trump rescinded from a 2014 President Obama directive. And she said the action also created a problem with perception.\n\n\"It sent a signal to people in the EU that the degree to which their data would be protected would be less than in previous administrations,\" she said.\n\nGuliani, who was on the conference call with European officials this month, said there are many other concerns about whether the agreement lives up to the standards set by European courts that struck down the old agreement.\n\n\"It's hard to understand how the Privacy Shield would be consistent with what the European courts have said,\" she said. \"To take something simple like redress ... there is no meaningful avenue - even for people in the U.S. - there's often no way to tell if you have been targeted by an intelligence agency.\"\n\nThese issues come amid a broader backdrop of privacy issues, with the Trump administration pushing for clean reauthorization of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act -- which governs large internet-surveillance programs and is up for renewal in Congress this year.\n\nSection 702 governs acquisition of data from internet infrastructure in the U.S., and its programs collect large amounts of \"incidental\" data from non-targets.\n\nSarah St. Vincent of Human Rights Watch said lesser-known surveillance under Executive Order 12333, which governs intercepts of communications from internet infrastructure outside the U.S., also is a concern.\n\n\"702 basically provides open season for non-U.S. citizens for surveillance,\" St. Vincent said. \"As bad as 702 is, 12333 is far worse. ... You see no judicial oversight ... and Congress is not holding hearings on 12333 - not publicly - so we don't know how much oversight they are exercising.\"\n\nAfter meetings in D.C., Jourová will visit California to discuss the Privacy Shield and other topics with tech company leaders including Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and representatives of Apple and Google.\n\nThe commission said Friday she will \"quiz tech companies on their experience with Privacy Shield and discuss the ongoing work on social platforms in the EU, including combating illegal online hate speech, user's terms and conditions, gender equality, especially in a tech environment and other upcoming EU initiatives.\"\n\nHate speech is legal in the United States, with few narrow exceptions, but social media giants increasingly have chosen to censor such content. Companies like Facebook generally acquiesce to local censorship standards of countries in which they operate.\n\nThe Commerce Department spokesperson did not say if the U.S. has major concerns with European implementation of the Privacy Shield. There's a carveout in European law for state security, St. Vincent said, making it unclear if European courts can hold member countries there to the same standard to which they hold the U.S. government.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
