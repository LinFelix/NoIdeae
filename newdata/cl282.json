The influential former Liverpool attacker found South African midfielder Andrew Surman in the middle of the box, who finished in the far left corner of the Brighton goal.\nIbe turned provider again little more than five minutes later, showing good control outside the area to hold onto the ball and play it through to veteran Defoe.\nThe 34-year-old did not need to take a touch as he span quickly and struck the ball low past goalkeeper Mathew Ryan to score his first goal in a Bournemouth shirt since he lined up alongside his now manager 16 years ago.\n\"He's an unbelievable professional. He sets the example. He wants to train every day, he doesn't want to be treated as a special case, he really wants to muck in and be one of the boys... He's got the finishing ability to score lots of goals for us,\" Howe told Sky Sports.\nAfter securing their first ever Premier League win last week over West Bromwich Albion, Brighton found they relaxed too much after going in front against the run of play.\n\"(I am) incredibly disappointed. They have a lot of quality and move the ball well but we handled it well for a lot of the game,\" Hughton told reporters.\n\"It was two poor goals we conceded. We never looked like conceding before then. I thought it was a really good period for us just before we scored.\"\nThe two sides meet again at the same venue on Tuesday in the third round of the League Cup.\nFollowing that, Bournemouth travel to Everton in the league next weekend while 14th-placed Brighton host Newcastle United.
