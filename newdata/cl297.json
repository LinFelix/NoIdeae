A\ncredit freeze restricts access to an individualâ€™s credit report,\nwhich prevents thieves from applying for credit using another\nperson's information.\nConnecticut Attorney General George Jepsen and more than 30\nothers in a state group investigating the breach said that while\nEquifax has agreed to give free credit monitoring to hack\nvictims, they asked Equifax to stop collecting any money to\nmonitor or freeze credit.\n\"Selling a fee-based product that competes with Equifax's\nown free offer of credit monitoring services to victims of\nEquifax's own data breach is unfair,\" Jepsen said.\nAlso on Friday, the chairman and ranking member of the\nSenate subcommittee on Social Security urged Social Security\nAdministration to consider nullifying its contract with Equifax\nand consider making the company ineligible for future government\ncontracts.\nThe two senators, Republican Bill Cassidy and Democrat\nSherrod Brown, said they were concerned that personal\ninformation maintained by Social Security Administration may\nalso be at risk because the agency worked with Equifax to build\nits E-Authentication security platform.\nEquifax has reported that for 2016, state and federal\ngovernments accounted for 5 percent of its total revenue of $3.1\nbillion.\nEquifax, which creates individual credit reports used by\nlenders to assess a consumer's creditworthiness, has come under\nintense criticism for what has been described as a slow,\ninadequate and confusing response to the hack.\nThe company has hired public relations companies DJE\nHoldings and McGinn and Company to manage its response to the\nhack, PR Week reported. Equifax and the two PR firms declined to\ncomment on the report.\n\n400,000 BRITONS AFFECTED\nInvestors have dumped Equifax's stock, with share prices\ndown more than a third since the company disclosed the hack on\nSept. 7. Shares shed another 3.8 percent on Friday to close at\n$92.98.\nEquifax, which disclosed the breach more than a month after\nit learned of it on July 29, said at the time that thieves may\nhave stolen the personal information of 143 million Americans in\none of the largest hacks ever.\nThe problem is not restricted to the United States.\nEquifax said on Friday that data on up to 400,000 Britons\nwas stolen in the hack because it was stored in the United\nStates. The data included names, email addresses and telephone\nnumbers but not street addresses or financial data, Equifax\nsaid.\nCanada's privacy commissioner said on Friday that it has\nlaunched an investigation into the data breach. Equifax is still\nworking to determine the number of Canadians affected, the\nOffice of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada said in a\nstatement.\nIn her letters to the regulators, Warren questioned the\noverall regulatory framework for credit reporting agencies,\nwhich are not subject to the same scrutiny as mortgage lenders\nor credit card providers.\nThe CFPB supervises credit reporting firms' compliance with\nconsumer protection laws but does not directly license or\nintensively monitor the companies.\nA spokesperson for the CFPB did not reply to a request for\ncomment.\n(Reporting by
