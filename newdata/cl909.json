Out of all of the top stories circulating on the interwebs, these are the ones that got people the most engaged:\n\nDiaper bag controversy stirs up stinky debate\n\nA story about a Winnipeg mom who was told not to bring her diaper bag into a Canadian Tire had Global News readers enraged this week. Nearly 8,000 readers reacted to, shared and commented on the article, landing it on our list of most-clicked this week.\n\nBut as there are two sides to every argument, Global News' Facebook followers -- including moms who chimed in from across the country -- were divided on the controversial incident.\n\nAnd the other side of the bag...\n\nStranded pets upset Global News readers\n\nThere's no doubt that Global News readers have been following Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma closely, but one story about residents abandoning their pets while fleeing Hurricane Irma really pulled at your heart strings. Readers interacted with this post more than 32,000 times, but there was no debate here: most commenters concluded that this was a heartless act.\n\nA dog walks through a flooded street in a rural part of Naples the day after Hurricane Irma swept through the area on September 11, 2017 in Naples, Florida.\n\n(Photo by Spencer Platt\/Getty Images) Mysterious sea creature has audiences' imaginations running wild\n\nIt's a scientific fact that any time you have a headline that starts with \"mysterious sea creature,\" it is going to gain traction in the social media sphere. A story this week about a mysterious sea creature that washed ashore during Hurricane Harvey got more than 10,000 people connecting on our social media channels.\n\nBut what did Global News audiences think it resembled? An ex-girlfriend without make up, someone's sister, and that scientist from The Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\nTrump's lawn-mowing gesture\n\nWe love this video, and apparently you did, too.\n\nIt has the air of an awkward sitcom, and undertones of the American dream, which could be why more than 2 million viewers watched this video of President Donald Trump taking up a offer from an 11-year-old boy to mow the White House lawn.\n\nThe back-story is that an 11-year-old named Frank wrote the president saying, \"it would be an honour to mow the White House lawn.\"\n\nTwo million views is a lot, and it also got almost 4,000 commenters, who were mostly charmed by the gesture.\n\nAnd Trump, who is usually making headlines for his controversial tweets and policy announcements, even got a little praise, too.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 20:17:10.465"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 20:17:10.111","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|1+FJWiq6EXg\/7fHgfwcxkY00bWQ=|SCybv8r35IbUd0N+cxYq9y67oehfi8vslBcRlQiQfoYAxQXIbIQcDw==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.914,"name":"Human Interest"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/bb3def0c-6842-3ee7-b6d4-eae8159a0e41","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Aircraft","importance":"1","originalValue":"Aircraft"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/3a11b1e7-8a83-3b71-98de-e94c844b21c0","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Carrier-based aircraft","importance":"1","originalValue":"Carrier-based aircraft"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/86db8e98-e630-3fed-9b1d-dbbcf27706cc","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Hawker Hurricane","importance":"1","originalValue":"Hawker Hurricane"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/9efd0bee-0479-336f-a246-d987f6406804","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Business","importance":"2","originalValue":"Business"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/4d6fe64b-62d4-3436-b6d6-c8428c7bd3a0","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Hurricane Harvey","importance":"2","originalValue":"Hurricane Harvey"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/70a49b00-55d8-3dca-a88f-e26b86216054","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Donald Trump","importance":"2","originalValue":"Donald Trump"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/SocialTag\/7":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/SocialTag\/7","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/359e9bfd-d04d-3ee5-931a-c69b04eac8d2","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"United States","importance":"2","originalValue":"United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/88ca8295-f281-32e9-81c0-d43150cf7da8\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Retail -
