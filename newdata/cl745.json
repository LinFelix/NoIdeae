We are against the system. We are against the process against the right to exercise our democratic vote,\" Goh told media after the protest.\n\nScores of Singaporeans dressed in black milled around the park, some holding up signs calling the presidency a \"(S)election\", while others wore T-shirts emblazoned with the hashtag \"not my president\", which first gained popularity among Americans unhappy with the victory of Donald Trump.\n\nOrganisers said about 2,000 people showed up to the protest but an AFP reporter counted about 800.\n\nGoh said an earlier rally was cancelled because a special police permit was needed since the event would have touched on race.\n\nSedition laws in Singapore make it an offence to promote hostility between different races or classes in the multiracial society, which is mainly ethnic Chinese with large Malay and Indian minorities, but critics say this stifles free speech.\n\nAuthorities decided to allow only candidates from the Malay community in the presidential election to foster harmony in the city-state of 5.5 million people which is dominated by ethnic Chinese, and give more opportunities to minorities.\n\nHalimah is the first Malay president of Singapore for almost five decades. The last was Yusof Ishak, president from 1965 to 1970, the first years of the city-state's independence.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
