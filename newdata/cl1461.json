Our youths are now roaming the streets. And when they do, we are not safe. We must engage the youth and for we to overcome all these challenges, our institution of learnings must incorporate entrepreneurial and technical courses in their curriculum\", he said.\n\nOn the part of the former Minister of Information, Prince Tony Momoh, while blaming the past administration for failing to save for the future, charged the graduands to cultivate the culture of saving for the future to avoid the mistakes of the past governments.\n\n\"The youth in Nigeria today, they lack understanding, for instance, when the last administration was there, we have to save money for the rainy day but we failed to do so. We ate the future in the present. Now you know, the present is today but yesterday, was the present. So yesterday, looking at today, we are looking at the future. All of you here, all your entitlements, you sat down and ate it.\n\n\"All of you who were growing up, what we should have done to empower you, we did not do. Today, you are deprived. Obasanjo left money, Yar' Adua left money and Jonathan inherited the money but unfortunately by the time he left, we have eaten the money and not Jonathan that ate the money but people ate the money\", he said.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
