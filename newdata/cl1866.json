Here are all the deets you need to make for a stellar conference experience.\n\nChecking-In\n\nDoors open to attendees at 7:00am on Monday and Tuesday and 7:30am on Wednesday. Programming begins at 9am each day. Print out your Universe ticket or pull it up on a mobile device for quick entry into Disrupt. Please bring your government-issued photo ID each day of the conference.\n\nRegistration\n\nUniverse is the official ticketing platform of Disrupt. If you purchased a ticket, you used Universe. We love them and we think you will, too. If you haven't purchased a ticket, please go do that here!\n\nLost Badge Fee\n\nDon't forget your badge every day - there is a $500 reprint fee for lost or misplaced badges.\n\nVenue\n\nDisrupt returns to San Francisco's Pier 48, just south of the ball park. It's baseball season so plan your trip accordingly.\n\nHotel\n\nStill looking for a place to stay? We've partnered with AllTheRooms to provide you with a multitude of accommodation options. Find the best places to stay from any price point.\n\nBook your room here!\n\nParking\n\nDisrupt SF's location at Pier 48 is great because it is close to public transit and easily accessible via any shared ride service. Click on this map for parking lots and transit stop locations. We strongly encourage you to take transit or ride-sharing service each day of the conference.\n\nThe Giants play at AT&T Park on Tuesday evening and Wednesday afternoon during Disrupt SF. Parking will be at a premium and Lot A will be closed to Disrupt parking on each day due to the games, so we urge you again to use public transportation or take a ride-share service if possible.\n\nPublic Transportation\n\nThe easiest way to transfer onto MUNI from BART is at Embarcadero BART Station; SF MUNI's 2nd & King and 4th & King stops are both a 10 minute easy walk to Pier 48.\n\nFor those coming from the South Bay, CalTrain San Francisco Station is very close to the venue and a light 10 minute walk to Pier 48.\n\nAs a registered attendee, you can log-in to the app to communicate with other attendees and get access to all of the content - have your Universe registration ticket ID or Universe account log-in.\n\nAny questions? Email disruptapp@techcrunch.com\n\nWomen of Disrupt Breakfast\n\nOur newest networking event, check out the Women of Disrupt breakfast on Tuesday from 8:00am - 9:30am. All female attendees of Disrupt will receive an invitation via Paperless Post to attend. If you have already registered and have not received your invitation, just indicate your interest here. Silicon Valley Editor, Connie Loizos, will hold a conversation with female founders from Away and Science Exchange and discover Alice, an artificial intelligence platform for women. Sponsored by Intuit.\n\nOn-site Nursing Suite\n\nMamava is returning to provide a private nursing suite on site at Disrupt SF. Dedicated cooler is stationed at the VIP help desk, if you'd like to store bottles during the show. Ask for more information at the VIP registration table at front registration.\n\nAfter Party\n\nTake a load off after a long day of networking. Hangout with TechCrunch at the After Party Tuesday night at the Chapel in the Mission. There will be games, drinks, prizes and trivia! Your badge to Disrupt gets you access. Make sure to bring your badge and your government-issued photo ID! This party is 21+.\n\nAmazon Web Services will have members of the AWS Solution Architecture team on-site at Disrupt to offer architecture review and expertise on leveraging the latest AWS services, along with the Startup Business Development team, comprised of former VCs and entrepreneurs to provide business and market guidance.\n\nMixHalo\n\nDon't miss any of Disrupt's content and seamlessly switch between the main stage fireside chats, Off the Record workshop sessions, the Battlefield competition and the Showcase stage, with Mixhalo. Using only wired headphones (don't forget yours!) and a smartphone, you have access to crisp audio directly from the mixing board. Download the MIXhalo app in the App store or if you are an Android user, borrow a device at the MIXhalo table at the entrance to the main hall.\n\nVerisign is the Official Domain Provider of Disrupt SF 2017! .com, powered by Verisign, is the world's premier web address -- the global standard for doing business online. They're meeting with startups at Disrupt to help them take the next step in growing their business.\n\nPerkins Coie\n\nPerkins Coie, a leader in emerging technology legal services will have IP and blockchain lawyers on hand at Disrupt SF to offer complimentary office hours to Startup Alley companies during Disrupt SF. Make sure to swing by their booth and get free legal advice. In addition to their emerging company and venture capital services, Perkins Coie can advise in areas such as artificial intelligence, AR\/VR, biotech, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, IoT, interactive entertainment and unmanned vehicle systems.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
