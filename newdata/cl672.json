Clarke was accused of plagiarizing his master's thesis in May and a July letter indicates that his alma mater, the Naval Postgraduate School, found a violation\n\nPictured is Clarke at the Republican National Convention in July 2016. Clarke was given 100 days to revise his thesis or face the revocation of his degree. The initial allegation of plagiarism found that he had failed to properly attribute sources at least 47 times. The July letter, written by the school's dean of students, found the violation was 'not a result of any intentional deception'\n\nThe letter from Commander Paul Rasmussen, dean of students, says the violation was 'not a result of any intentional deception.'\n\nIt's not clear if Clarke has made revisions.\n\nThe Associated Press sent a message seeking comment to Clarke's office Friday.\n\nIn response to the CNN report, Clarke told radio host Joe Pags: 'They're saying certain words and phrases I should have put quotation marks around. OK, alright, fine. Maybe from a formatting standpoint the thesis isn't perfect, but the content is there.'\n\nClarke announced this month that he would join a political action committee supporting President Donald Trump. He resigned as sheriff on August 31.\n\nThe president also tweeted a promotion last month for 'Cop Under Fire,' a memoir by the sheriff.\n\n'A great book by a great guy, highly recommended!' Trump tweeted.\n\nPictured is Clarke at the National Rifle Association - Institute for Legislative Action Leadership Forum in April 2017. Clarke said of the plagiarism allegations: 'They're saying certain words and phrases I should have put quotation marks around. OK, alright, fine. Maybe from a formatting standpoint the thesis isn't perfect, but the content is there'\n\nClarke is pictured with Donald Trump (pictured center, with former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani at right). Clarke has supported Trump since his campaign and Trump has in turn endorsed the controversial sheriff. Trump tweeted support of Clarke's memoir, 'Cop Under Fire,' in May\n\nThe sheriff was a consistent and ardent supporter of Trump throughout his campaign and presidency. He greeted Trump during his visit to Milwaukee and attending post-election meetings in Trump Tower.\n\nClarke even claimed to have been offered the position of Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Partnership and Engagement by Trump.\n\nHowever, the Department of Homeland Security said no official offer had been made and Clarke later backed off, saying he'd chosen not to accept the alleged proposal.\n\nClarke and his office have been dogged by a string of controversies.\n\nThey include claims that he abused his power to have a man detained and removed from a Milwaukee airport after the pair exchanged words on a flight from Dallas.\n\nThe man, Milwaukee resident Dan Black, is now suing the department over the alleged January 15 encounter, in which he says he confirmed Clarke's identity and then shook his head ruefully.\n\nClarke reportedly then texted his men in Milwaukee: 'Follow him to baggage and out the door. 'You can escort me to carousel after I point him out.'\n\n'Just a field interview, no arrest unless he become an a*****e with your guys,' he reportedly also texted.\n\nClarke is pictured leaving New York City's Trump Tower in November 2016. Clarke resigned as Milwaukee County sheriff on August 31 and left a string of controversies in his wake\n\nClarke's other controversies include saying he would 'choke out a Democrat' during a speech to Trump supporters and shouting 'Blue Lives Matter' at a Republican National Convention.\n\nMore seriously, he has racked up at least $310,000 in legal fees for his private attorney due to litigation against Milwaukee County - with taxpayers footing the bill, according to Associated Press.\n\nThe county has also paid at least $83,000 defending against lawsuits made against Clarke, who assumed office in 2002.\n\nPictured is Donald Trump, who has expressed support for David Clarke\n\nAnd the Sheriff's Department has suffered a string of horrifying claims, including the death of Terrill Thomas in 2016, who died of dehydration after the water to his cell was cut off. He was reportedly refused water by department staff.\n\nIn May 2017, a Milwaukee County jury advised that charges be brought against two supervisors and five officers under Clarke's command.\n\nIn 2014, two women sued the department for shackling them while in labor - a practice banned by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nin June of this year, a federal jury awarded $6.7 million to a woman who said a Milwaukee County Jail guard had raped her nine times while she was imprisoned.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to lesser charges, causing charges of sexual assault made against him to be dropped.\n\nAnd in July last year, the county supervisor and Democratic lawmakers called for Clarke's resignation after Shad√© Swayzer, a mentally ill pregnant woman, lost her daughter after she went into labor while in prison.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
