USA Today reports:\n\n...just as his initial statements on Charlottesville blamed \"all sides\" for the violence, Trump's signing statement didn't condemn any specific group.\n\n\"It is ironic that this bill is in response to Trump's tone-deaf comments about 'all sides' and then when he signs this statement, he repeats the very thing that sparked the controversy in the first place,\" [Christopher Kelley, a Miami University political scientist] said.\n\nIndeed, some members of Congress suggested that the signing statement -- combined with Trump's renewed remarks Thursday holding the left-wing \"Antifa\" protesters equally responsible for the violence in Charlottesville -- showed a lack of sincerity by the president.\n\nYa think?!?\n\nJust as he has blamed \"all sides\" for violence, Trump's signing statement didn't condemn any specific group. https:\/\/t.co\/jYRiE6CVGB\n\n-- San Antonio Now (@SanAntonioCP) September 16, 2017\n\nI predicted he would do that.
