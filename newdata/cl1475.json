I spent £30 on trousers only to be told he couldn't wear them. I haven't got £30 to waste.\n\n\"Why should my son be put in isolation because he's been wearing the uniform he has since starting the school?\n\n\"Do you think that because my son is in a pair of grey trousers he will be a genius?\"\n\nVanessa Williams had a similar experience because her daughter Abigail's black Doc Marten boots had yellow stitching.\n\nIn addition, Abigail was pulled up because her Next schoolwear range trousers were too 'skinny' and her hair was not a 'natural' colour.\n\nVanessa was one of several parents who said the cost of school uniform was too high.\n\nShe also questioned how keeping children out of lessons was helping their education.\n\nShe said: \"It should be about education. To me, it's like education is being lost in this. She's been given bits of work but she's not doing lessons. It's like it's gone a bit mad.\n\n\"She looked so smart and I was so proud when I sent her off.\"\n\nWhen asked about the uniform policy and the decision to place students in isolation or detention, headteacher Jules White said: \"If a parent wishes to raise a concern about their child's education at Tanbridge House they are very welcome to contact their child's form tutor, subject teacher or leader of year.\n\n\"If they remain concerned then our complaints policy should be used.\n\n\"As ever, we always apply our exceptionally high standards - academic or otherwise - with rigour, fairness and professionalism.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
