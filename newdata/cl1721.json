All the provider needs is a computer and internet access. That provider can also add notes to the record, which are sent to the originating healthcare organization.\n\n\"The advantages are huge from a patient perspective,\" said David Muntz, principal at health IT consultancy StarBridge Advisors and former principal deputy at HHS' Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. \"We used to see wheelchairs moving charts from the car to the office, literally, and this has eliminated that challenge.\"\n\nEpic said it's been chipping away at lack of interoperability -- long hindered by technical complexity and privacy concerns -- with many of its products.\n\nIndeed, Share Everywhere does help patients get their medical records from one provider to another and could help meet meaningful use requirements.
