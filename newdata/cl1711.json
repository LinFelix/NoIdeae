However, it said yesterday that it planned to contact \"fewer than 400,000\" British consumers to offer them \"appropriate advice\" to help safeguard and reassure them.\n\nWe routinely allow our personal details to be stored by scores of organisations such as government departments, utility companies, banks and insurers - and we trust them to keep it safe.\n\nMany will be reconsidering that trust following the Equifax breach.\n\nSo how can you find out who holds data about you, whether it's safe and how to force them to delete it?\n\nWhat are my rights?\n\nCompanies that keep your data must follow strict principles under the Data Protection Act 1998.\n\nYour information must be used fairly and lawfully for \"specifically stated purposes\".\n\nThe data must be accurate and kept for \"no longer than is absolutely necessary\".\n\nFirms must inform you when they collect your personal information.\n\nYou have the right to know what they are going to use it for and where your data may be shared.\n\nOnce your information is out there, it's out thereJames Freedman\n\nCheck the organisation's privacy notice to find out what it intends to do with your information and if it intends to share it. If unclear, ask for clarification.\n\nSome firms will give your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. In such cases they should seek your prior consent.\n\nYou have the right to know what has happened to your data and if it has been shared. You are entitled to ask a firm to stop using it.\n\nHow do I find out who has my data?\n\nYou can make a \"subject access request\" to any organisation you think may hold information about you and it is legally required to send you the details in \"intelligible form\".\n\nThere may be a charge for the disclosure, usually of no more than £10. There is a different fee structure for organisations that hold credit, health or education records. The maximum fee for health or education files is £50.\n\nIn some cases - involving crime, tax or national security, for example - your data might be withheld and the organisation concerned will not have to explain why.\n\nYou also won't be given a copy of personal information concerning another person. A subject access request should be sent in writing. Full details of what to ask, and a template letter, are on the website of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).\n\nThere is no central database to check what information has been shared with firms without your knowledge.\n\nHow do I get a firm to delete my information?\n\nYou can ask an organisation to stop using your details if you are receiving unwanted marketing material, but it won't delete your data entirely because it will need to keep some details to maintain its \"do not contact\" list.\n\nIf your request is ignored you can take the firm to court or complain to the ICO.\n\nGabriel Voisin, a data protection lawyer at Bird & Bird, said recent cases confirmed that compensation for distress was available even if the claimant could not show a monetary loss.\n\nJames Freedman, a fraud prevention ambassador for the City of London Police, suggested editing accounts so they did not include your current information before closing them down.\n\n\"Your real information will still be out there somewhere, but if the organisation is attacked the hacker will just see your edited profile,\" he said.\n\nIf you need help deleting your account, he suggested using justdelete.me, an online directory.\n\nThe website also rates how difficult some companies make it to delete profiles.\n\nFor example, it says Amazon and iTunes accounts are hard to delete and Netflix is \"impossible\".\n\nHow do I find out if my data has been compromised?\n\nEnter your email address on haveibeenpwned.com, which reveals if it has been involved in any breach and if so which companies are concerned.\n\n\"Once your information is out there, it's out there. It's better to take measures to protect your details before a company is hacked,\" said Mr Freedman.\n\n\"Just because a firm hasn't been attacked yet it doesn't follow that it never will be.\"\n\nHe advised people to \"compartmentalise\" their information.\n\nFor example, you can set up a number of email addresses to handle communication for different accounts such as banking, online shopping and utility bills.\n\nWhen companies ask for your mobile phone number, Mr Freedman suggested using temporary and disposable \"burner\" numbers, which are available on smartphones via apps such as Flipper, which costs £3.99 for a month.\n\nHow do I complain if I think my details have been misused?\n\nContact the firm directly. If you're unhappy with the response you can complain to the ICO.\n\nThis should be done within three months of the last contact with the firm involved. The ICO will investigate the company and ask it to sort out the problem. It will not award compensation.\n\nIf your complaint involves a regulated financial business, you may be able to seek redress from the Financial Ombudsman Service, which is free.\n\nThe ombudsman's role is not to decide if the organisation has breached data protection laws, but it can look at the impact any breach had on the customer and order the firm to pay to put things right.\n\nNew data protection laws next year\n\nIn May next year the Data Protection Act will be replaced by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will take effect before Brexit and remain in force thereafter, the Government has said.\n\nThe main changes include tougher penalties for breaches and tighter rules regarding when a firm must admit to a breach: they will have to inform the data protection authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of an incident.\n\nCustomers will have to be told without \"undue delay\".\n\nIndividuals will also be able to \"port\" their data under certain conditions and ask the firms that currently hold it to transfer it to a new organisation.\n\nThe ICO will be given the power to impose larger fines for breaches.\n\nMr Voisin said this was \"a way of making organisations take data protection seriously\" but said the other changes were \"marginal\".\n\nThe Government has said that consent given to companies that hold personal data must be explicit and easy to withdraw.\n\nGetting hold of your data will be made simpler and not subject to a charge, as long as the request is not \"excessive\".\n\nParents will have to consent to information services for children under 13. People will also be allowed to ask for their personal data to be removed from social media postings made during childhood.\n\nTips for keeping your information safe\n\nMr Freedman said there were a number of steps people could take to protect their personal information.\n\nDon't use the same contact details for all of your accounts. Create a number of separate email addresses that do not include your name and use different phone numbers. Lie. Do firms, other than those central to your life such as banks, really need your full name, date of birth and home address? Mr Freedman suggested giving organisations your first initial rather than your full name and giving a false date of birth and fake mother's maiden name. Don't use the same passwords for every account. Once criminals have your password and username for one service, they can use free online software to see if they've been reused on other websites. Telegraph Money witnessed this being done and it took just minutes. Make your social media accounts private. Fraudsters can piece together tiny bits of information you share to steal your identity. Keep an eye on your credit report to see if your personal details are being misused.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
