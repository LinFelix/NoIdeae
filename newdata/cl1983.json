Many of them are traumatised, malnourished and weak.\n\nHealth personnel from Rohingya camp areas in Ukhia and Teknaf said rising number of people, mostly children, are visiting the health facilities with diarrhea, fever, cold and skin diseases.\n\nLed by the civil surgeon, doctors and nurses of the public hospital with support from the UN agencies, international and national NGOs are conducting the programme.\n\n\"We have already got all the supplies necessary from the government and non-government agencies, and mobilized additional health personnel from neighbouring upazilas to conduct the vaccination campaign,\" said Salam.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bangladesh government has taken a set of decisions, including one to set up 14,000 additional shelters on some 2,000 acres of land near Kutupalong in Cox's Bazar for Rohingyas.\n\nSix displaced Rohingya families would be accommodated in each shelter.\n\nThe Disaster Management and Relief Ministry will coordinate the matter with Armed Forces Division, Border Guard Bangladesh, Risk Reduction for Resilient Cities, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, International Organization for Migration, World Food Programme and other agencies to construct these shelter centres within 10 days, the report said.\n\nThe current humanitarian crisis began following an August 25 attack by the insurgent Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on police and military posts in the northwestern state of Rakhine that had led to a violent offensive by the Myanmar Army.\n\nMyanmar's military says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies targeting civilians.\n\n--IANS\n\nsoni\/vm\n\nSEARCH","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
