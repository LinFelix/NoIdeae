It's right by the ocean and I have nice view from my apartment, and everyone seems so nice and very friendly.\"\n\n\"The reason why I came here was because it was the best place for my course - Ocean Sciences.\n\n\"It has the best facilities, a wet lab, two boats and everything else that I could really hope for.\n\n\"I guess it could do with a decent rock bar! It's not like Birmingham where there are load, but I'm sure I'll find one soon.\"\n\nLayton Beaton, First Year studying Architectural Technology and Environment\n\n\"Look around, Plymouth has everything you could want. Everything is here: the shops, the Hoe, and everything else.\n\n\"The traffic is a nightmare, though. But, I guess, being from the countryside, it's something I get used to. There are way too many one way streets.\n\n\"I've been very impressed with Beckley Point and the staff here so far. Any complaints and they are straight on it!\"\n\nMaria, second year student\n\n\"I chose Beckley Point because it's in the city centre and quite close to the university.\n\n\"Last year I was living on North Road West and I felt lonely there so I wanted to come to a place where I could socialise a bit more.\n\n\"It's a great city to be in, though. I like it here so far.\"\n\nCheri, first year international student\n\n\"It's our first day here and it's very nice. Plymouth is beautiful and peaceful - it's very good.\"\n\nJacob, first year international student\n\n\"When I first came, my first word was \"WOW!\"\n\n\"Everything is amazing and very nice. It's a very suitable place for students.\n\n\"Beckley Point is also a famous building and it's one of the tallest buildings in the city. The facilities are very nice too. I am impressed.\"\n\nHolly Watson, first year photography student\n\n\"Being here is a nice change to what I'm used to, it's something different and I'm looking forward to meeting new people.\n\n\"I'm impressed with the halls [Beckley Point]. They looked really good, it's brand new - which is really nice - and its close to the university.\n\n\"Plymouth is a really nice place, too. It has a really nice vibe to it and I'm excited to get out and have a look around a bit more.\"\n\nChloe Godding, First year Environmental Science student\n\n\"Where I live (just outside of Leicester) it couldn't be further away from the coast.\n\n\"I don't get to go to the coast often so when I came here I really liked it. It's also a great place for my course as well as there is obviously a lot of natural environment around us here.\n\n\"It just feels like a really friendly and warm city and I knew that when I got here it was where I am meant to be.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 20:17:56.013"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 20:17:55.347","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|nppna\/NhnfIuUgJrzOr5HuQFxzc=|FisUAMBTQpPempb92Lr1\/px8E10TgKHf3ZWhllEzcJCc9FE78hECYQ==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d03ee7b3-ada4-38ef-a881-663315dd9cc8\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d03ee7b3-ada4-38ef-a881-663315dd9cc8\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d03ee7b3-ada4-38ef-a881-663315dd9cc8\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/e82c3d81-1be3-3a0a-9e53-8f2f6bdbce0f","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Plymouth, Massachusetts","importance":"1","originalValue":"Plymouth, Massachusetts"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d03ee7b3-ada4-38ef-a881-663315dd9cc8\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d03ee7b3-ada4-38ef-a881-663315dd9cc8\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/aba85aa8-4cb4-388a-b0b8-cc7f4f950ee5","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Geography of Massachusetts","importance":"1","originalValue":"Geography of Massachusetts"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d03ee7b3-ada4-38ef-a881-663315dd9cc8\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Integrated Telecommunications Services -
