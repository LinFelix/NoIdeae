Mormino's forthcoming book, \"Florida and the Age of Fear: 2000-2017.\" He is professor emeritus of Florida history at USF St. Petersburg.\n\nFor millennia, tropical storms shaped and reshaped the place we call Florida. Powerful winds and currents pushed and pulled flora and fauna from distant lands and islands to Florida. The Taino Indians of the Caribbean called the destructive storms el huracán. Spanish navigators learned the demonic tones of the native word. In the Caribbean, Spanish officials typically named hurricanes Santa María, San José, and Santa Ana, aligning the storms with saints' days.\n\nWhen compared to the most severe Mediterranean storms, el huracán combined a fury and power rarely seen by mariners. On the last voyage of Christopher Columbus, the mariner encountered a hurricane near Santo Domingo. According to the Spanish scribe Las Casas, \"After 30 or 40 hours, there came such a rare tempest and so violent, that in many years sailing on the seas of Spain and in other areas had not seen one equal, nor so sorrowful had they experienced. ... It seemed as if all the army of demons had escaped from Hades.\"\n\nFor all of the leaps in technology, modern science offered little help in warning Floridians of an approaching storm until recently. When the 1921 hurricane approached St. Petersburg, city officials hoisted storm-warning flags a few hours before landfall.\n\nIn what was seen as a dramatic leap in technology, the weather bureau announced in August 1935 that 12 Southern cities were now linked together by teletype writers capable of transmitting storm conditions. The technological leap was little comfort to the many families who lost members during the Labor Day hurricane of that year.\n\nHurricanes dashed the dreams of Spanish kings, Old South planters and New South merchants, altering the arc of Florida history. The hurricane of 1561 brought ruin to the de Luna colony that had managed to settle on Pensacola Bay, thus allowing the upstart settlement of St. Augustine to claim the title of America's oldest permanent city. Four years later a hurricane scattered a French fleet dispatched to relieve Fort Caroline, built along the St. Johns River. The Spanish raided the French colony, and then put to the sword the storm-tossed Huguenots.\n\nHurricanes in the 1840s snuffed out the promising antebellum towns of St. Joseph and Port Leon. A wall of water obliterated Cedar Key's prosperity and promise in 1896. \"Cedar Keys is a place of desolation and death,\" eulogized the Tampa Weekly Tribune.\n\nSome hurricanes pack such a wallop that they urge political action. In September 1926, a seething storm smashed Miami Beach and Miami, leaving in its wake one of the costliest hurricanes in American history. The storm killed 372 inhabitants and left nearly a third of Dade County's residents homeless. The hurricane helped prick the real estate bubble.\n\nIn 1928, a storm so powerful that locals swore it \"blowed a crooked road straight,\" killed thousands on the southern shore of Lake Okeechobee. Congress was so appalled at the disaster that it passed an appropriation to build a huge earthen berm to encircle the lake. The 143-mile Herbert Hoover dike, erected in the 1930s, now surrounds the lake. It would not be the last effort to engineer the Everglades.\n\nThe year 1947 witnessed two hurricanes that struck Broward County, part of a deluge that saw Dania officially register 103 inches of rain for the year. The year witnessed the publication of Marjory Stoneman Douglas' Everglades: River of Grass, and the dedication of Everglades National Park. Floridians cheered that the Glades has been saved and preserved. But less noticed, officials representing agricultural interests fought for congressional authorization to drain new portions of the Everglades.\n\nIn 1953, the Weather Bureau began assigning women's names to hurricanes. Predictibly, TV weathermen exploited the opportunity to feminize Nature. \"Temperamental\" hurricanes \"flirted\" with Caribbean islands and \"teased\" the mainland. Roxcy Bolton, a Florida feminist and founder of the Florida chapter of the National Organization for Women in 1966, confronted the male establishment at the National Hurricane Center in Dade County over the naming of storms. Finally, in 1979, the season's second storm debuted as Hurricane Bob.\n\nHurricane Donna crossed Marathon in the Florida Keys before skirting Naples and making landfall at Fort Myers in September 1960. The storm leveled many beach cottages and wooden hotels, paving the way for modern redevelopment. The county seat of Collier County, Everglades City, was engulfed by six feet of water. The county seat was quickly moved to Naples, a city buoyed by Donna's insurance windfall.\n\nThe historical legacy of hurricanes meant little to the millions of South Floridians who resided in 1992 along the Gold Coast, the population-rich region comprising Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties. Few could recall the last hurricane that mattered. Then meteorologists began tracking the season's first storm, later described by the Miami Herald as \"a Category 5 chainsaw called Andrew (that) cut a swatch of ruin like no storm before it.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1993, a storm with the intensity but not the name of a hurricane remained stranded in the Gulf of Mexico, smashing the coastline for days. It is remembered as Florida's \"No-Name Storm.\" Weather models simply missed the significance of the 1993 storm. \"I believe it was the beginning of modern weather forecasting,\" observed Mike Clay, a Tampa Bay meteorologist.\n\nNo single individual did more to professionalize the study and discussion of hurricanes than William R. Gray, who introduced the idea of the Atlantic hurricane season and annually predicted the number of storms. In a 2001 address in Florida, he warned, \"We will see damage in Florida like we have never known.\"\n\nHow right he was. In the memorable 2004 hurricane season four storms wracked the peninsula. And last week came Irma.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
