It is also generally accepted that social problems -- crime, violence, lawbreaking, murders, assault, etc., have greatly increased.\n\nWe live in an age where science has blessed us in many ways. Wouldn't it be helpful to have some branch of science study the causes of this rapid decline in social and civil conduct? As is true with all science, one must be free of any bias and prejudice. The 80-year period between 1937 and 2017 might be an appropriate period to study.\n\nWe would hope that the studies would include some factors that we have observed in our own lifetimes. Each of us were blessed to be raised in families with mothers and fathers who taught their children respect for others, loyalty to our country, right and wrong, etc. We felt the unity and love between them, along with that which is most important, their examples in living that which they are taught.\n\nWe have continued to follow their examples by teaching these values to our own children, and now at the ages of 91 and 87, we see these same characteristics in our grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Of course, many, through various circumstances, are denied some of these ideal circumstances, however we all can do our best in any situation.\n\nThe study of the cause of global warming is vital, as is the study of that which creates noble citizens.\n\nDon and Carolyn Robertson\n\nSpanish Fork","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
