That should make us utilize the 12% in an effective manner that ensures we are able to deliver on our core business,\" Jean said.\n\nShe also referred to the perennial problem of untimely school repairs that still disrupt the re-opening of schools across the country, as was the case almost two weeks ago. She attributed this returning problem to the fragmentary work done on schools over the years.\n\nJean believes it would be better to work each year on at least a small number of schools to bring them back to their original condition rather than take the allotted cash and spread it to all schools on the island as this could only result in disjointed or haphazard work, especially since there is not enough funding for schools.\n\nBoth Jean and the Chief Education Officer, Marcus Edward, spoke of an exciting year ahead for the Ministry.\n\nSaid Jean: \"Over the past few months, we have been doing a number of exciting things in the Ministry, a few new initiatives that really show we are at least ready to advance education in St. Lucia.\"\n\nShe spoke of the initiative termed #EducateSt.Lucia, which is about ensuring that every St. Lucian receives formal education. This initiative involves removing age as barriers to education: the idea is to provide education to St. Lucians from the cradle to the grave to get the society much more literate.\n\nThe Ministry will also be focusing on greater ICT integration in schools as well as on innovation as a component to education. As such, scouting for innovative ideas and projects from students will be done.\n\n\"We must try to harness the innovation coming from our students and spin them off into some kind of gainful employment,\" Jean said.\n\nSoon to become a reality is the establishment of two centres of excellence despite discussions and consultations still ongoing in that regard. AnseGer Secondary School will be transformed into a centre of excellence for the creative arts and culture while Gros Islet Secondary School will be designated for sports.\n\nThe changing demographics are also now forcing the merger of schools as the population in the various districts decreases. Already merged are the George Charles Secondary School and Jon Odlum Secondary School to form a new entity called the Stanley Jon Odlum Memorial Secondary School.\n\nOther plans in the works at the Ministry include the reviewing of subject areas, accelerating the Early Learners Programme into full force, building strong literacy skills at the infant level, the development of a mathematics guide and diagnostic tool, and the revamping of the Special Education Programme.\n\nShare This","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
