The total was 2,771 for the issue, 939 against.\n\nThe money from that bond issue will be used for a variety of projects, including the construction of an elementary\/intermediate school that will house students in the fourth, fifth and sixth grades.\n\nThe plan, according to Superintendent Dr. Jason Simeroth, is for the building to be in place by the fall of 2021.\n\nSixth-grade students currently attend an academy that is located at the Yukon Middle School. However, based on the community's growth, officials believe a new facility is needed.\n\nSimeroth has said the proposal is to eliminate the academy and have students in those grades attend one of three intermediate schools.\n\nThe new building is expected to cost about $28 million. Construction should begin in 2019, said Simeroth.\n\nThe bond also will pay for technology upgrades, software licenses and improvements to the district's buildings ranging from new carpeting and desks to new roofs.\n\nThe second bond issue was for $1 million and will be used to purchase new buses.\n\n\"We're just thrilled the community has continued to show support and belief in what we are doing,\" Simeroth said Tuesday after the results were announced.\n\n\"We will live up the expectations and push for an enriched environment for our kids,\" he said.\n\nSchool Board President Suzanne Cannon agreed.\n\n\"I am very grateful to our community for placing an emphasis on the education of our children,\" she said.\n\nCannon said is she not surprised by the support from the community. It's been more than 40 years since a bond issue was defeated.\n\n\"The patrons of the Yukon School District almost always support the schools. They know that we never ask for a bond issue until the previous one is paid off, so there is no effect on the millage. People understand our growth, they know that people are moving to Yukon for our school district. So I'm not surprised,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't want to take anything for granted, but I am proud of the support from the community,\" Cannon said.\n\nThe school district last passed a bond issue in 2008. Money from that bond paid for the construction of the building that houses Yukon High School. It was a 10-year bond issue.\n\nSchool board members voted to sell $10 million in bonds last month. That sale leaves about $3 million in bonds to be sold on that issue. Simeroth said those bonds would be sold next year, along with the first bonds from the issue approved Tuesday.\n\nThat won't slow the process, however.\n\nSimeroth said the district will begin making plans so once the bonds are sold, officials can move forward quickly.\n\n\"We have enough time from the vote to have the best plans in place,\" he said.\n\nThe next step, Simeroth said, is to begin doing research about what should be included in the building.\n\nMuch like the bond issue, which was the result of a number of community meetings and an online survey from district residents, Simeroth said community input will be a key element of developing the new school.\n\n\"We wanted the community to be involved. That's why we had the meetings and the surveys. We took the input from our stakeholders,\" he said.\n\nCannon said that involvement was an important element in the success of the bond issue.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
