Created 100 years ago, the party has never been part of the national government, only serving at local level.\n\nIn the wake of the refugee crisis in Europe, the party has been pushing to establish special employment assistance and improving the quality of language teaching for migrants.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
