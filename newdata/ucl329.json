And that was even before Hurricane Harvey\nlanded, knocking out a quarter of U.S. refining capacity,\ncrippling production of fuel products.\nThanks to surprising summer demand, particularly from\nexports, inventories of diesel, jet fuel and heating oil were\nheading into the busy winter at their lowest levels in three\nyears.\nHarvey's effects cost refiners even more production of fuel,\nraising the possibility of shortages and higher prices if the\nUnited States suffers another major disruption or an\nunexpectedly frigid winter.\nSince 2000, between June and September distillate\ninventories have risen by an average of 10 percent, but this\nyear, they fell by 2.2 percent, the first decline since 1982\nwhen record-keeping began, a Reuters analysis of U.S. Energy\nInformation Administration data shows.\nThe summer is typically when refiners build stocks of\ndistillates to meet growing fall and winter demand for heating\noil and crop harvesting.\n“If we get another hurricane or similar event, things could\nget real tight,” said Robert Campbell, head of oil products\nmarkets at London-based Energy Aspects.\nInventories typically remain flat or rise modestly through\nSeptember, and while some refiners delayed scheduled work, the\nloss of the Gulf has hit overall U.S. refining. As a result of\nHarvey, distillate stocks fell another 4.6 million barrels in\nthe first two weeks of September, EIA data shows.\nU.S. distillate stocks are now at three-year lows for this\ntime of year, and 5.2 percent below their historical average.\nThe last two winters have been among the warmest ever\nrecorded, but forecasters this year are predicting a colder,\nmore typical season, according to Reuters data.\nProfit margins have jumped to five-year highs as a result,\nwhich should incentivize U.S. refiners to run plants at full\ntilt and thwart any supply concerns, but an unexpected event\ncould change things.\nSeveral refineries are still in the midst of restarting\nplants in the U.S. Gulf, where 4.4 million barrels of capacity\nwas taken down due to Harvey.\nU.S. supply issues could test the resiliency of an export\nmarket that is expected to grow in upcoming months. The\nInternational Energy Agency said on Wednesday that global fuel\nstocks could soon fall below five-year averages \"because of the\nimpact of Hurricane Harvey.\"\nThe unusual inventory drawdown was fueled in part by growing\ndemand in Latin America, which could feel the sting of reduced\navailability of Gulf products.\nHarvey's impact is also being felt in Europe, a big export\nmarket for the United States. European diesel stocks are\nexpected to fall at the fastest rate in at least three years in\nSeptember as U.S. imports slow, traders have told Reuters.\nGulf exports to Europe are expected to drop to about 500,000\ntonnes in September, far lower than the 1.5 million to 2 million\ntonnes seen in previous months, according to traders and\nshipping data.\nThe inventory also sets the stage for a bullish run in the\ndiesel market. The 3-2-1 crack spread &lt;CL321-1=R&gt;, a measure of\nthe profit refineries make from converting three barrels of oil\ninto gasoline and diesel, is at $20.63 a barrel, the highest\nlevel seasonally since 2012, and more than $6 above the average\nduring that time.\nIn addition, future-dated diesel contracts are trading at a\nlower rate than the current spot price, also known as\nbackwardation, which incentivizes refiners to supply the market\nand not put product in storage to sell later. The reverse\ncondition, contango, would motivate refiners to store product.\n“Inventories are looking pretty healthy and without any\ncontango there is not much in storage,” one trader said.\n\n\n(Reporting By Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
