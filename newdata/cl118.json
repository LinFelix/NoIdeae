Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. Security Council have urged Myanmar to end the violence, which he said was best described as ethnic cleansing.      \nMyanmar rejects the accusations, saying its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against the insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which claimed responsibility for the Aug. 25 attacks and similar, though smaller, attacks in October.\nRussia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said on Friday that while Moscow was concerned \"we cannot discard the fact that it was triggered by terrorist activities.\"\n\"We're talking to the Myanmar government, of course,\" he told reporters. \"We are concerned with what is happening. ... We are looking forward to an early cessation of the violence and to elevating the humanitarian situation of the population.\"\nThe government has declared Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army a terrorist organization and accused it of setting the fires and attacking civilians.\nEthnic cleansing is not recognized as a separate crime under international law but allegations of ethnic cleansing as part of wider, systematic human rights violations have been heard in international courts.\nRights group Amnesty International said evidence pointed to a \"mass-scale scorched-earth campaign\" across the north of Rakhine that was unmistakably ethnic cleansing.\n\"The evidence is irrefutable – the Myanmar security forces are setting northern Rakhine state ablaze in a targeted campaign to push the Rohingya people out of Myanmar,\" said Tirana Hassan, the group's crisis response director.\nThe group said it had detected 80 big fires in Rohingya areas since Aug. 25. While the extent of damage could not be verified, due to access restrictions by the government, \"they are likely to have burned down whole villages\".\nIt said it also had credible reports of Rohingya militants burning the homes of ethnic Rakhine and other minorities. About 30,000 non-Muslims have also been displaced.\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday he had spoken with Suu Kyi and that she said she was working to get aid to areas in Myanmar affected by violence.\nThe generals still control national security policy but nevertheless, Suu Kyi has been widely criticized abroad for not stopping or condemning the violence. The campaign against the Muslim insurgents is popular at home.\nThe U.N. refugee agency said the Rohingya arriving in Bangladesh were suffering \"real hardship, and some of the most difficult conditions seen in any current refugee situation\".\n\"With the influx increasing daily, UNHCR is appealing for an initial amount of $30 million for the emergency humanitarian response in Bangladesh until the end of year,\" an agency spokesman said in Geneva.    \nBangladesh says all refugees must go home and has called for safe areas in Myanmar. Myanmar has ruled that out and says it will accept anyone who can verify their citizenship. Most Rohingya are stateless.\nThousands of people demonstrated after Friday prayers in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, to denounce the treatment of the Rohingya. \nOne protest leader said they were demanding a U.N. peacekeeping force and that Myanmar face charges in an international court.\n\n (Additional reporting by Danish Siddiqui in COX'S BAZAR, Serajul Quadir in DHAKA, Michelle Nichols at
