It's a more personalized and proactive version of Siri, and one that might show up in other Apple OSs and devices. Siri is slowly using more artificial intelligence to behave more like a human assistant who knows enough about you to give you helpful little nudges and reminders at the right times during the day. In theory, the more the assistant learns about you, your habits, and your habitat, the more insightful and helpful those little assists can become.\n\nMost of the big tech companies are now developing their own personal assistants in one form or another. To feed them, many tech companies tend to vacuum up as much of your data as they can from your various devices and the cloud services you use. They then use powerful cloud computing and machine learning to combine and analyze that data. This allows them to connect a lot of dots about your habits, intents, and preferences. Those learnings can then be used to offer helpful and insightful assists. For instance, knowing your dining history, location, time of day, and other data, a digital assistant might suggest a well-liked pizza place that's not crammed with customers.\n\nBut in Silicon Valley's growing AI war, one narrative that's emerged over the past year says that Apple's AI efforts lag behind the work of other big tech companies in part because of its dedication to protecting user data. Among the big tech companies, Apple has taken a hard line on privacy and has tried to resist any collection of personally identifiable user data in its servers. The company has repeatedly argued-sometimes in court-that your personal data should be kept private, untouched by the police, advertisers, or even, in most cases, by Apple itself.\n\nBy not sending users' personal data to the cloud, it's been argued, Apple may be hindering Siri's potential, starving the AI models it depends on of the personal data needed to more personalized and informed assistance to users.\n\nApple has been relatively silent on that narrative. But several members of Apple's AI and Siri teams who recently spoke to Fast Company said user privacy and smart AI are not competing principles.\n\n\"I think it is a false narrative,\" said Greg Joswiak, Apple's VP of product marketing. \"It's true that we like to keep the data as optimized as possible, that's certainly something that I think a lot of users have come to expect, and they know that we're treating their privacy maybe different than some others are.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
