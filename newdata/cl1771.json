Cutler.\n\n\"Featuring an array of well-known modern political figures, The Breach will bring audiences behind the scenes of an event that changed Washington forever -- the first impeachment of an elected president in American history,\" Lehrer said in a statement. \"This drama builds upon our core scripted programming slate of compelling, contemporary storytelling that embraces our recent history and we are confident R.J. will bring a unique vision to President Clinton's gripping story.\"\n\n\"Set at the dawn of the cable news wars and the social media revolution, The Breach is a remarkable political story,\" added Cutler. \"It's the origin tale of how our government was broken and has never really healed. It's also a thrilling tale of personal and professional ambition, of enormous hubris in the name of acquiring power, and of personal foibles, all of which nearly brought down a presidency.\"\n\nCasting is currently underway.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 19:56:38.093"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 19:56:37.822","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|34FrrEf5OX\/HVSUDEfiBuJOpQWk=|gv6wWKucMCGKvrcsOkh88G+MtTkyb2DLG0xD8beE+jZUjm7DXedGXg==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":1,"name":"Entertainment_Culture"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/cat\/2":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.916,"name":"Politics"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/ed8237a2-c7ce-39d1-a4f3-d924b8e13384","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Lewinsky scandal","importance":"1","originalValue":"Lewinsky scandal"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/450a0fe4-479f-343b-8ca1-2ced72c6b3ef","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Politics of the United States","importance":"1","originalValue":"Politics of the United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/359e9bfd-d04d-3ee5-931a-c69b04eac8d2","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"United States","importance":"1","originalValue":"United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/34b0d471-2a5d-3c08-879a-a8bfd5792383","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Accountability","importance":"2","originalValue":"Accountability"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/b06cd009-504d-372d-a221-c1eed653aa7c","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Impeachment","importance":"2","originalValue":"Impeachment"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/1ba74542-0826-30ae-8776-ccbf92f359db","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Bill Clinton","importance":"2","originalValue":"Bill Clinton"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/SocialTag\/7":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/7bad42fb-d36a-3da4-b630-a329eb4884d3\/SocialTag\/7","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/80f52604-edaa-3b66-9356-3fb3f7b6f0b5","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"R.
