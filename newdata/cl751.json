TRISHA HARBORD brings you Top 10 spots at home and abroad . . .\n\nAS an area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Wye Valley is hard to beat - and the best way to experience the area on the border of England and Wales, is to walk.\n\nCeltic Trails runs an easy to moderate 136-mile walk over six to 16 days starting in Chepstow and ending in Hereford, Hay-on-Wye or Rhyd y Benwch.\n\nIt takes you through limestone gorges, along riverside trails and forest tracks and up to vantage points with amazing views.\n\nThere's also a chance to visit the ruins of Tintern Abbey, built in 1131, and stay in book town Hay.\n\nGO: A six-night Wye Valley walking break this month or October costs from £485, including B&B in farmhouses and inns, luggage transfers and route planning. See celtictrailswalkingholidays.co.uk.\n\nAMERICANS came up with the term leaf-peeping and New England is the place to see a kaleidoscope of colour.\n\nBillions of leaves in The Fall are just starting to change from green to orange, red, yellow and gold in Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\nAnd you don't have to go far to see the fabulous foliage at Sebasco Harbor Resort, Maine.\n\nSet in 450 acres of woodland where you can hike to Merritt Mountain and Robinson's Rock or see the leaf display dazzling in the sunshine from a kayak on the ocean which fringes the resort.\n\nGO: Four nights' room only at the 4V Sebasco Harbor Resort including Virgin Atlantic flights from Heathrow to Boston on October 4 and car hire, from £784 per person. See virginholidays.co.uk.\n\nHAVE an adventure in the treetops on the UK's longest and highest canopy walkway.\n\nThe new 350-metre trail is 20 metres above the ground at Groombridge Place, near Tunbridge Wells, Kent.\n\nYou will be getting as close as it gets to the autumnal golden leaves of oak, beech and chestnut trees which make up the ancient forest.\n\nIt's a great day out for families as there are also rope swings, zip wires, a maze, a pirate ship Crusoe's World and various animals and birds.\n\nNearby Hever Castle & Gardens also has guided tours of its Autumn Colour Trail, see hever castle.co.uk\n\nGO: Groombridge Place entry adult £12.95, child 3-12 £9.95.

Groombridgeplace.com\n\nTHE Forestry Commission's Feel Good Autumn campaign lists Grizedale Forest as a top leaf-peeping spot.\n\nBetween Coniston and Windermere lakes, the beech, maple and oak trees provide a backdrop of stunning colour.\n\nThere are lots of marked trails for cyclists, who can choose a gentle ride along bridleways or an adrenalin rush down thrilling mountain routes.\n\nSwing through the trees on zip wires at Go Ape! and look out for the 40 sculptures littered through the forest.\n\nStaff at the visitor centre will help plan your day. See forestry. gov.uk\/grizedale.\n\nGO: Double room, with breakfast, at Grizedale Lodge, a former hunting lodge near Hawks-head, from £99 a night.

The domes, which sleep four, have a wood-burning stove, bean bags and lanterns.\n\nYou need to bring bedding, towels and crockery. The site, between Aber- feldy and Killin, also has a TV and games room and a restaurant.\n\nGO: A dome sleeping up to two adults and two children costs from £75pp a night, minimum two-night stay.

Have fun, if you dare, wobbling along the 100ft rope bridge stretching across the jungle floor. It's not as easy as it looks.\n\nThe gardens, near St Austell, have a harvest celebration of crafts, cookery and garden demos September 23 to October 8.\n\nGO: Adult £14.50, child £6.50, under 5s free (heligan.com). B&B at nearby The Vean at Caerhays Castle from £90 per person a night (caerhays.co.uk).\n\nIF going deep into a forest isn't for you, take a city leaf-peeping break.\n\nWith 400,000 trees binding its canal banks together, Amsterdam is one of the greenest cities in Europe.\n\nSo in autumn, more than a fifth of the Netherlands' capital is bathed in orange and red foliage.\n\nAnd as there are more bikes than people, it is eco-friendly too.\n\nHire a bike and ride along protected paths or in the many green spaces including Vondelpark and Rembrandtpark or take a boat trip along the tree-lined canals.\n\nAmsterdam is buzzing between October 18 and 22, when the city hosts an electronic music event with more than 2,000 DJs and artists playing in clubs and bars.\n\nGO: Two nights' room-only at the four-star NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter Hotel, from London Southend on October 18 from £228 per person or from Manchester, including B&B at the hotel, from £232.
