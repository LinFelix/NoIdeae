The grants will cover initiatives such as new sport programs, upgrades to facilities or projects that improve participation in sport.\n\nMinister for Sport, Stuart Ayres said the program is part of a $10 million sport grants package announced by the NSW Government.\n\n\"Women's sport is the fastest growing area of many codes and we are now seeing more big name sponsors and media networks recognising the public's appetite for prime time viewing, but more needs to be done, including cultivating participation at a grass roots level,\" Mr Ayres said\n\n\"From the bush to the city, sport is the lifeblood that unites communities. This is not just about female programs though, I encourage all sporting groups to apply for grants that will help people of all ages and abilities get involved in their local club or become more active.\"\n\nGrants are now open until 6 October 2017.
