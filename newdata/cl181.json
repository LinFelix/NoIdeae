The Indians' 22-game winning streak is the second longest in major league history. The 1916 New York Giants won 26 in a row.\nJason Vargas (16-10) gave up three runs on five hits in five innings to get the win for Kansas City. Mike Minor pitched the ninth to pick up his first major league save.\n\nRed Sox 13, Rays 6 (15 innings)\nDeven Marrero had a two-run double as part of a seven-run outburst in the top of the 15th inning as Boston earned the win against Tampa Bay.\nBoston maintained a three-game lead over the New York Yankees in the American League East Division. The Red Sox magic number to reach the postseason dropped to seven.\nTampa Bay has lost three of its past four games and remains 5 1\/2 games behind the Minnesota Twins for the second AL wild card.\n\nDiamondbacks 3, Giants 2\nA.J. Pollock stroked a go-ahead, two-run double in the seventh inning, allowing Arizona to rally past San Francisco in the opener of a three-game series.\nLeft-hander Robbie Ray ran his personal winning streak to five games with 10 strikeouts in seven innings, helping the Diamondbacks retain a five-game lead over the Colorado Rockies in the National League wild-card race.\nArizona won its eighth straight on the road despite playing without hot-hitting J.D. Martinez, who was a late scratch with a stiff neck.\n\nAngels 7, Rangers 6\nC.J. Cron's two-run home run capped a five-run sixth inning to help lift Los Angeles to a win over Texas.\nThe Angels also got offensive help from Justin Upton, who doubled twice, drove in one and scored twice, and Andrelton Simmons, who had two singles and two RBIs.\nA big night from the offense was something for which the Angels were particularly hopeful, considering they went into the game without a starting pitcher.\n\nYankees 8, Orioles 2\nLuis Severino tied a career high by pitching eight innings while Didi Gregorius homered and drove in four runs, leading New York to a victory over Baltimore.\nSeverino (13-6) allowed two runs on three hits and little else while improving to 8-2 in 12 starts since the All-Star break. He struck out seven and walked one while throwing 95 pitches.\nIt was the third time Severino completed eight innings. He also did it April 18 vs. the Chicago White Sox and May 24 against the Kansas City Royals.\n\nTigers 3, White Sox 2\nMikie Mahtook grounded an RBI single up the middle to score rookie Jeimer Candelario with two outs in the ninth inning as Detroit snapped a six-game losing streak with a victory over Chicago.\nCandelario drew a walk off former Tiger Al Alburquerque (0-2) with one out in the bottom of the ninth. Tyler Collins, whose fifth home run of the season in the seventh gave Detroit a brief 2-1 lead, walked on a 3-2 pitch by lefty reliever Aaron Bummer.\nJuan Minaya relieved and moved the runners up with a wild pitch before Mahtook delivered his game-winning single up the middle on a 3-2 pitch. It was his first career walk-off hit.\n\nAthletics 4, Phillies 0\nStarter Daniel Mengden, backed by two early home runs, turned in the most dominant outing of his young career, going the distance as Oakland blanked Philadelphia.\nThough Mengden (1-1) entered Friday night with a 7.07 ERA in three big-league starts scattered over the course of the season, the 24-year-old right-hander absolutely shut down a Phillies offense that had put up 27 runs in its previous three games.\n\nDodgers 7, Nationals 0\nAlex Wood allowed just three hits in six scoreless innings and was backed by three early home runs as Los Angeles crushed Washington in a showdown of first-place teams with the two best records in the National League.\nThe Dodgers, who had lost eight of their previous 10 outings, entered with a magic number of seven to clinch the NL West. The Nationals have lost three of four since clinching the NL East title Sunday.\n\nReds 4, Pirates 2\nZack Cozart homered twice, Scott Schebler and Joey Votto each added a solo shot, and Homer Bailey allowed a run over five-plus innings, lifting Cincinnati to a victory over Pittsburgh in the opener of a three-game series.\nBailey (5-8), who returned this season after missing most of the past two seasons with injuries, walked two and struck out seven, helping the Reds improve to 11-6 versus the Pirates this season.\nThe Pirates have lost three straight games.\n\nBlue Jays 4, Twins 3\nJosh Donaldson and Kevin Pillar each hit solo homers, and J.A. Happ pitched into the seventh inning to propel Toronto to a win against Minnesota.\nDonaldson had three hits and two RBIs as Toronto came out on top in another close game. The Blue Jays have played 17 one-run contests in their last 31 games, going 8-9 in that span.\nHapp (9-10) surrendered three runs on seven hits. He walked five in 6 1\/3 innings. Three relievers combined for 2 2\/3 hitless innings and Roberto Osuna recorded his 36th save in 46 chances.\n\nBraves 3, Mets 2\nThe Braves beat New York in Atlanta for just the sixth time in the past 22 games, as the bullpen preserved the victory for left-hander Sean Newcomb after the rookie took a hard-luck home loss to the same team in his major league debut.\nNick Markakis and Rio Ruiz each had two hits and Ozzie Albies extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a double as the Braves won for the seventh time in their last nine games.\nNewcomb (3-8) allowed six hits and two runs in 5 1\/3 innings. He struck out eight, including five in a row during the fourth and fifth innings, and walked one while throwing 81 pitches.\n\nCubs 8, Cardinals 2\nKris Bryant went 3-for-4, including his 27th home run of the season, to help lead Chicago to a victory over St. Louis in the opener of a critical three-game series.\nThe victory was the fourth straight as Chicago extended its NL Central lead to four games over the Cardinals with 15 games to play. St. Louis dropped its second in three games.\nWinning pitcher Carl Edwards Jr. (4-4) worked a scoreless sixth inning for the victory in place of right-handed starter John Lackey, who was ejected in the fifth after arguing home plate calls.\n\nAstros 5, Mariners 2\nCarlos Correa and Evan Gattis recorded multi-hit games, Charlie Morton delivered a quality start, and Houston inched closer to an American League West pennant with a victory over Seattle.\nHouston jumped on Mariners left-hander James Paxton (12-4) for three first-inning runs in his return from a five-week stint on the disabled list.\nCorrea finished 2-for-4 while Gattis went 2-for-3 with a walk. Both recorded run-scoring hits in support of Morton (12-7), who allowed just one run on five hits and one walk with seven strikeouts over six innings. It marked the first time Morton worked at least six innings while allowing fewer than two runs since a 9-5 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Aug. 16.\n\nRockies 6, Padres 1\nColorado turned to Tyler Chatwood somewhat by default on Sept. 5 to be the No. 5 starter, and he has been getting better and better. He made his third start of the month and muffled San Diego.\nChatwood, who is eligible for free agency after the season, worked 5 2\/3 innings and held the Padres scoreless until Wil Myers belted his career-high tying 28th homer to end Chatwood's 94-pitch outing.\nThe homer also halted Chatwood's scoreless streak at 13 innings since he returned to the rotation this month after not starting since Aug. 2. In his three starts, Chatwood is 2-0 with a 0.66 ERA.\n\nBrewers 10, Marlins 2\nThree home runs -- including a grand slam from Neil Walker -- sparked an eight-run rally in the eighth inning as Milwaukee erupted late for a victory over Miami.\nPlaying in front of a crowd of 19,369 after the series was shifted to Milwaukee from Miami because of Hurricane Irma, the Marlins got 4 2\/3 innings out of Jose Urena.\nThe Brewers received yet another effective effort from the bullpen as they used seven relievers to cover eight innings behind Jeremy Jeffress, who went two innings in his first start as a big leaguer.\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
