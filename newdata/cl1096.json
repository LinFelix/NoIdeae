If so, you're in excellent company, my Virgonian friends, because according to Harvard's Amitabh Chandra, yours is the most popular birthday in the good ol' U.S. of A. It's fun to be popular!\n\nAstrology is not just your horoscope. It actually involves lots of math, and your horoscope is the result of your astrologer applying that math to human experience. For every degree of all twelve signs of the zodiac, there exists a Sabian Symbol. These visual representations were originally channeled by a clairvoyant woman (and fellow Virgo!) named Elsie Wheeler, back in 1925.\n\nOn September 16 of every year, the Sun falls on the 23rd degree of Virgo. This degree is special -- the Sabian Symbol for it is of a lion tamer displaying their skill -- and indicates strength of character and a willingness to strive towards self-mastery.\n\nDiscernment is a strong quality for Virgos in general, and if you have this birthday, your discernment needs to be applied to your sexuality, not just your mind. Getting embodied, embracing your sexuality, and harnessing your personal power with the radical act of self-acceptance are all parts of being a 9\/16 baby. This isn't about having sex, per se, but the virility that flowers from your sexual center. One of the things that I love about the Virgo sign is that it's arguably the feminist sign -- it's the only one symbolized by a lady human and known for her wit. For those born on this day, you're built to stand up to social pressures while in search of what's real and true. So much of your work in life is in finding your voice. This is kind of a heavy cross to bear, but if anyone is strong enough to do it, it's a Virgo. You're likely to have had to transcend personal struggle to find that voice.\n\nWhat's so interesting about the astrological birth chart is that it's kind of a chicken\/egg thing. Your birth is the result of actions outside of your control, before you were even a pea. Early conditions in your family, including those related to your conception, shape your birth chart and your nature. So if you were born in September, that means that you were conceived in the cold winter month of December, somewhere around Christmas time. Even if you're not of Christian origins, you're still from a place where the whole country stops to celebrate. During this time, most people get a break from work, a reminder to value one another, and the space to drop into the physical act of love (I know I'm talking about your parents doing it -- sorry!). People are also inclined to more depression and loneliness during the holiday times, so it stands to reason that they find sexy ways to connect.\n\nIn astrological terms, we're talking about being conceived in Capricorn season, a time when we're meant to invest in the things that count. Capricorn vibes can be a bit of a buzzkill, what with all the obligation and responsibility that they bring, which accounts for why some people tend to get heavy-hearted around this time. One of the results of being conceived in such an intense time, when the ways in which we're connected are on everyone's minds, is that you are a self-reflective, contemplative lover. As a result, September 16 babies need to avoid getting tripped up by ideas of love, and instead strive to be present for the real thing.\n\nSo go hug a Virgo! There's probably one sitting next to you right now. ὒe\n\nJessica Lanyadoo is an astrologer, a psychic medium, and an all-around nice lady who wants to help you help yourself. She gives readings full-time, has lectured extensively, and petted many cats with great enthusiasm. Read her horoscopes, get a personal reading, or take a class with her because it'll be awesome.
