This is a policy that would bring great blessing to this country and so those trying to draw us back are enemies of the people.\"\n\nNii Adjei Kraku's lament comes in the wake of the Education Ministry's reported dismissal of two Headteachers and the interdiction of nine others for allegedly extorting monies from students in spite of the rollout of the Free SHS.\n\nA total of nine others were interdicted, Director General of the Ghana Education Service (GES), Professor Kwasi Opoku Amankwaah, announced at a press conference on Thursday.\n\nDr. Nii Adjei Kraku ll applauded the GES' swift execution of the disciplinary action saying it is a good message to others that the government is not joking with the interest of the people.\n\n\"I will urge the government to continue to police the implementation of the policy so that it really becomes the blessing that it is supposed to be,\" Nii Tema said.\n\nHe also thanked all institutions who are helping and encouraging the implementation of the policy, singling out Stanbic Bank for praise for making its staff wear SHS uniforms to work in show of support for the policy.\n\n\"I hope beyond wearing school uniforms, Stanbic will also contribute financially towards the sustenance of the policy,\" Nii Tema said.\n\nTema Manste commended the Fishing harbour branch Manager for his good works saying that \"he had made the place a destination for Ghanaians looking for a place to bank.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
