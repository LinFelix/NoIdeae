And there are a few things that most members of the committee seem to agree on, said committee chair Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.).\n\n\"During those [first two] hearings, three themes emerged that I believe represent a working consensus for stabilizing premiums in the individual insurance market in 2018,\" he said in his opening statement. \"The first theme [is] congressional approval of continued funding of the cost-sharing payments that reduce co-pays and deductibles for many low-income Americans on the exchanges. I have recommended that we continues those payments through 2018.\"\n\nHELP Concludes Hearing Series\n\nAt the fourth and final hearing, members of the Senate HELP Committee appeared determined to craft a bipartisan bill to stabilize the ACA's individual health insurance market, but its final shape remains uncertain.\n\n\"The easier part for the Democrats is more money. The easier part for Republicans is more flexibility and vice versa. So, we have to put those two together,\" said Alexander, adding later: \"Sometimes the last decisions are the hardest.\"\n\nWitnesses on both sides of the political divide agreed that continuing premium subsidies for low-income people is critical. Each also recommended either re-insurance or a high-risk pool.\n\nOther suggestions for stabilizing the insurance market included raising premium subsidies for \"young invincibles,\" giving states more flexibility to design their own insurance products and returning funding to Obamacare navigators.\n\nCBO Takes Down White House Claims on Obamacare\n\nIn a new report, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that, if the ACA's insurance premium subsidies and the individual mandate are left in place, premiums will rise modestly through 2026 and the rate of uninsurance will stabilize near the current rate.\n\nThese projections fly in the face of President Trump's repeated assertions that Obamacare is \"failing\" and \"collapsing.\" The projections are, however, based on the assumption that current law -- i.e., the ACA -- remains intact through the 2017-2026 period.\n\nAs long as the subsidies and individual mandate remain, the CBO projected \"demand for insurance by enough people, including people with low healthcare expenditures, that the number of insurers in the marketplaces would stabilize and insurers would be willing to sell non-group policies in almost all areas of the country throughout the next decade.\"\n\nAvastin Clone OK'd Alongside Other Drugs, Apps\n\nAmgen's biosimilar for the angiogenesis-inhibiting biologic drug bevacizumab, to be sold as Mvasi, was approved Thursday by the FDA, the agency announced.\n\nThe original bevacizumab (Avastin) is a top-selling drug for a variety of solid-tumor cancers and is also widely used off-label to treat neovascular ophthalmologic conditions such as \"wet\" macular degeneration. Mvasi will carry the generic name bevacizumab-awwb and is approved for glioblastoma with progressive disease following prior therapy, metastatic colorectal cancer, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and certain cervical cancers, all in combination with other drugs, according to the FDA announcement.\n\nOther approvals this week include:\n\nCSL Behring's Privigen brand of human intravenous immune globulin for the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, with the goal of alleviating neuromuscular disability and preventing disease worseningreSET, an app that delivers cognitive behavioral therapy for patients with substance use disorders, excluding opioid abuseBesponsa, a conjugated monoclonal antibody inotuzumab ozogamicin for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, made by WyethCopanlisib (Aliqopa), a kinase inhibitor for adults with relapsed follicular lymphoma who have received at least two prior systemic therapies\n\nNext Week\n\nThe House is not in session.\n\nOn Tuesday, the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee will discuss SUTENT (sunitinib malate) oral capsules, for \"the adjuvant treatment of adult patients at high risk of recurrent renal cell carcinoma following nephrectomy.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate Special Committee on Aging will discuss disaster preparedness and response.\n\n1969-12-31T19:00:00-0500\n\nlast updated 09.15.2017","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
