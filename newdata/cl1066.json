I also weed out Abbott supporters and Coalition voters. There is no man suave, good-looking or funny enough for me to overlook this gross lapse of judgment.\"\n\nThis is Sam Kurikawa, 39, a Melbourne-based change advocate who's been online dating for three years and will ask a man who he votes for before she'll agree to a date. Last week she knocked back a suitor who said he was too busy to have thought about the same-sex marriage vote.\n\nAccording to Kurikawa, having alignment with her partner's world view is the most critical part of a relationship: \"I want a guy who seduces me with dirty talk, like gender equality and fair distribution of wealth, not pussy-grabbers or rabid right-wingers who think the 1950s were a great time to be a man.\"\n\nKurikawa has company. While politics has long been showing up as a significant influence on online dating choices, it's left-leaning, well-educated women like her who are most likely to make it a deal-breaker. They include political preferences in their dating profiles and usually approach men who are on the same page politically. It matters to them far more than most people.\n\nPeople who aren't passionate about politics don't want to end up watching the news with someone who shouts at the television set. So they try to steer clear of the zealots, according to Gregory Huber and Neil Malhotra, political studies professors from Yale and Stanford. Their research, published in The Journal of Politics earlier this year, looked at messages sent between people using an online dating site and found most seek potential partners who are like them politically but the issue is not as important in partner choice as religion, age, or education and about half as powerful as race.\n\nSo for most people politics is one factor influencing their choice of partner, but far from the critical one. Only 14 per cent of online daters even included \"political interests\" in their profile, according to a 2011 study - The dating preferences of Liberals and Conservatives - published in the journal Political Behavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarold*, 71, is a Melbourne lawyer who dated online before ending up in his current relationship. He's a lifelong leftie yet didn't include his political views in his profile because he's had past relationships with conservative women and doesn't see this as a big issue. \"I might make an exception for a neo-Nazi or Hansonite,\" he says.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nHe finds most women he meets are pretty left-wing and wins them over with his favourite line comparing Donald Trump to the Hindenburg - \"a huge windbag catching on fire and heading for the ground\".\n\nOf course there are also many women who are relaxed about a potential partner's political beliefs.\n\n\"I didn't state my political preferences in my online dating profile. I am a bit left on some things and a bit right on others and I feel loving someone doesn't require having the same views on politics,\" says Wendy, 64, one of my Sydney clients who's now living with the man she met after being online two months.\n\nHer partner jokes that men tend to be more tolerant of the political leanings of the women they meet, \"particularly if there's a possibility of getting their end away\".\n\nMaybe men do play their political cards more carefully, lest they spoil their chances of a bit of nookie. But in the five years I've been working as an online dating coach I've found it is mainly hard left-wing women who let politics rule their dating preferences. I had a client who gave one prospect the chop when he mentioned he listened to Alan Jones. Many others are horrified by dates who speak favourably of any Trump policies. Another confessed she and her friends have a deal that there'll be \"no sex with anyone who likes Tony Abbott\".\n\nMen are often bewildered by how quickly women pull the plug if they step over the political line.\n\nAndrew, 45, is a marketing executive whose most recent relationship came unstuck because his new partner found it hard to tell her friends that he occasionally writes for The Spectator Australia - a magazine which tramples on the left's cherished shibboleths like climate change, same-sex marriage and feminism. \"I'm actually only just right of centre, for heaven's sake,\" Andrew grumbled.\n\nIt's telling that left-wing women emerged as the most likely group to unfriend someone who disagrees with them on Facebook, according to a poll by the US Public Religion Research Institute released late last year. Democratic women were three times more likely to take this step than their Republican counterparts.\n\nA survey of 500 people who used Elite Singles found just 34 per cent of women said they'd be comfortable dating someone whose political opinions contradicted their own, but 54 per cent of the men said they wouldn't consider it a problem.\n\nOf course it does depend on how forcefully those views are expressed. Sally, 53, met her online partner nearly two years ago. She's always been a leftie and he'd had years working for John Howard and Andrew Peacock.\n\nAmongst other problematic issues their political differences started to grate, particularly his angry rants about \"snowflakes\" and the alt-left. The final straw was a lunch with gay friends where her partner exploded over allegations that Trump was eroding LBGTIQ rights. \"I decided I had had enough. I do not like angry men,\" said Sally.\n\nSally is back online and doing just fine. Living in rural NSW, she jokes that she is working her way through the agricultural sector, currently dating a horse farmer, with a man with a sheep property as her Plan B. And then she's also close to spud-growing territory ...\n\nOn the Fairfax site RSVP, over two-thirds of members describe themselves as having no strong political beliefs, but a greater proportion of the women label themselves as left (16 per cent compared to 13 per cent of the men). The gap widens with the older, well-educated groups, where nearly a third of the women are self-defined lefties compared to 22 per cent of the men.\n\nOlder, well-educated left-leaning women also emerged as the group most likely to include politics amongst their interests in a US study, \"Do bedroom eyes wear political glasses - The role of politics in human mate attraction\". The authors suggest that these older, more established women might be more willing to post political content in their dating profiles because women who are more financially successful have less need for resources from potential mates.\n\nIt's an interesting thought. It's true that many of my older clients see finding a partner as simply the cream on an already tasty cake. They have busy, full lives and don't need a man - hence they are determined to go for broke and won't put up with a man with political views they see as on the nose.\n\nMen can find that very irritating. Max Manning is a Melbourne-based electronics wholesaler who describes himself as \"very tolerant of difference generally\". He originally stated he was right-wing in his profile but \"took it out in response to astonishing, censorious comments from various potential future ex-Mrs Mannings\".\n\nWomen's political views aren't a big deal to him when it comes to choosing new dates: \"That's very low on my shopping list.\"\n\nHe feels differing political views can \"add spice to things, provide fodder for conversation. If the partners are respectful then it's not an issue.\"\n\nManning finds hard lefties very tedious and judgmental. \"Men like me started out as lefties and then grew up and out. Women tend to remain stuck in old patterns, less open to political growth. They need to grow out of their childish, second-year uni views. Jesus, girls, leave it OUT.\"\n\nThat's not going to happen. If anything it seems more women are moving further left. An article in The Economist last year entitled \"The lefter sex\" reported that since the 1990s women voters have been moving to the left in many countries.\n\nThere's a bunch of factors pushing women in that direction: more women work in unionised jobs and in the public sector; growing numbers of divorced women receive government benefits as single mothers; and leftie politicians' endless promises of more money for health and education have greater resonance with mothers.\n\nYet many remain middle of the road, valuing exposure to views different from their own.\n\n\"Diverse political views provide a great opportunity to expand our tolerance,\" says Michelle, 48, a divorced single mother who's learnt a lot about politics through meeting new men. Her openness was stretched to the limit when, on the night Trump was elected, her date took her to a celebration party filled with men delighted at the likely impact on their share portfolios.\n\nMichelle still welcomes the richer political conversation offered through online dating: \"It's wonderful meeting people who challenge our own narrow perspectives. That can only be good for us all.\"\n\n* Some names and personal details disguised.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
