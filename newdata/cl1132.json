The fast-fashion retailer was most recently embroiled in a controversy with Gucci when the Italian house accused it of trademark infringement for co-opting its iconic stripes. But it gets arguably worse: Forever 21 is currently being accused of copying the design of a T-shirt created in order to raise money for Planned Parenthood. Not a good look.\n\nThe shirt in question was created by Word, a woman-owned branding agency based in Los Angeles. It depicts the word \"woman\" translated into nine different languages and is intended to \"represent our belief that feminism and human rights should be intersectional. Women from all races, cultures, religions & economic backgrounds deserve access to safe medical care,\" reads the product description on the site.\n\nWord posted about the similar design on Instagram on Thursday, (shown above), captioning the side-by-side images of the two shirts saying, \"we're not ones to point fingers but this looks mighty familiar. For the record, we created this shirt with a purpose.\"\n\nPeople on Twitter aren't happy:\n\nNot only are people expressing outrage about what appears to be a fairly blatant rip-off of Word's design, but they're also noting that Forever 21's version chose to omit the Swahili, Hebrew, Chinese and Arabic representations, making it all the more questionable.\n\nIt's disturbing to see a fast-fashion giant rip off any designer's work, but in this case it's especially disheartening, given that the original item had such clear, positive messaging -- not to mention Word puts its money where its mouth is, donating 25 percent of the proceeds from the sale of these shirts to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"The Creator Shirt is Word's contribution towards the fight for better women's healthcare in the United States and abroad,\" reads the product description on the site. \"Women are creators, givers of life. The well being of a woman's body should be of the utmost importance.\"\n\nWord's Instagram post called for Forever 21 to donate all of the money it received from the sales of their version of the shirt to Planned Parenthood. At the time of writing this post, it appears that Forever 21 is no longer selling its version of the shirt.\n\nShould you want to buy the original shirt, you can head to Word's site, where it's still being sold for $25.\n\nFashionista has reached out to both Word and Forever 21 for comment.\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter and get the latest industry news in your inbox every
