He said his business,\nToday's Vision, was shuttered for almost five days after\nHurricane Harvey struck because nearby flooding kept employees\nand patients from getting there.\nArnold says he pays $1,083 per month for coverage. But after\nhe filed a claim, he said his insurer rejected it because his\nbusiness was not physically damaged.\nBusiness interruption policies typically require \"direct\nphysical damage\" as a condition of coverage, said Loretta\nWorters, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute,\na insurance industry-funded communications group.\nIt was Arnold's second disappointing experience with\nbusiness interruption coverage. He said another insurer denied\nhis claim in 2008 after a nine-day power outage from Hurricane\nIke.\nDevastating storms are hitting the United States with\nincreasing frequency. Risk modeling firm AIR Worldwide predicts\nlosses to all properties from the flooding in Texas alone will\nbe $65 billion to $75 billion, regardless of whether they are\ninsured.\n(For a graphic on the costliest U.S. hurricanes, see http:\/\/tmsnrt.rs\/2f8nowX)\nThe income lost by shuttered firms makes up a significant\nchunk of overall losses from a natural disaster and can hobble\nthe pace of a community's economic and social recovery.\nHurricane Katrina in 2005, for example, caused about $25\nbillion in insured commercial losses, of which $6 billion to $9\nbillion has been attributed to business interruption, according\nto information posted on AIR's website.\nThe National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)does not offer a\nbusiness interruption component. The program is largely used by\nhomeowners, but it also covers commercial structures for up to\n$500,000 in damage, with another $500,000 for the contents.\nThat is why companies able to afford the additional\nprotection of business interruption insurance, usually large and\nmedium-sized firms, often purchase it despite the potential for\nunsuccessful and drawn-out claims.\nBig Star Honda, a car dealership in Houston, lost 600\nvehicles - 95 percent of its inventory - and was shut for five\ndays after Harvey.\nIts managers are now girding themselves for a potentially\nlong slog with the firm's insurance company as the dealership\nprepares to make a claim on its business interruption policy.\n\"We’re collecting every single invoice that pertains to the\nhurricane,\" said Allen Paul, Houston regional vice president of\nKen Garff Automotive Group, which owns the dealership.\n\"I'm really curious to see how that goes,\" he said.\nThe dealership also has a flood policy through the NFIP, but\nrelatively few firms do. As of June 30, 2017, the NFIP had just\n264,681 non-residential policies, said a spokeswoman for the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency, the agency that runs the\ngovernment-backed flood insurance program.\nThat figure covers businesses but could also include\nchurches, private schools and community centers, and is a sliver\nof the estimated 2.4 million small businesses located in\nflood-prone Florida alone.\n\nNUMBER CRUNCHING\nInsurers such as Travelers Companies Inc and\nHartford Financial Services Group Inc are bracing for a\nwave of claims from businesses in Texas and Florida.\nThey face a daunting task. The size and scope of the two\nstorms, which pounded the states within two weeks of each other,\naffected everything from energy refineries to hoteliers.\n\"Insurers are craving information now,\" said Allen Melton,\nAmericas Leader of Insurance Claims Services for Ernst &amp; Young\nLLP. \"They want to know how big a claim we are looking at and\nwhat the issues are.\"\nThe answers to those questions are often difficult for\nbusinesses and insurance companies to pinpoint. Both sides often\nhire their own forensic accountants to comb through\nprofit-and-loss accounts from the current and prior years.\nIt can take months, and sometimes years, for a policyholder\nto receive monies owed. Insurance brokerage Aon PLC is\nstill working on claims from Hurricane Matthew, which struck\nSouth Carolina last October, said Jill Dalton, who leads claims\nfor Aon.\nMany business owners in the storm-ravaged Florida Keys are\nnot even close to estimating their losses because they cannot\nget to their properties yet.\n\"When you have property damage, you can pretty much figure\nout how much it costs to buy nails and a hammer and wood,\" said\nGary Marchitello, North American Head of Property Broking for\nWillis Towers Watson PLC. \"But reasonable minds can\ndiffer about how the business would have done if the loss hadn’t\noccurred.\"\nPayouts can hinge on factors such as whether a storm hits\nduring a slow season or if a business can make up for lost time\nin another quarter.\nBack in Texas, Arnold, the optometrist, is rethinking his\ncoverage. \"I'm going to sit down with my insurer and drastically\ncut my insurance,\" he said.\n\"If my office burns down or a tornado hits it, I want\ncoverage for that,\" Arnold said. \"But if people come in my\noffice and steal my glasses, I'll pay for that.\"\n(Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn; Editing by Carmel Crimmins and\nMarla
