Jovetic had the first chance of the match in the 8th when he hit the crossbar after being fed by the Colombia forward.\n\nFalcao made it 2-0 after halftime from an offside position that was not spotted by the officials, and sealed the hosts' win with a low shot into the bottom right corner after making the most of a defensive mistake from Strasbourg captain Kader Mangane.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
