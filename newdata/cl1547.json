Definitely, does not deserve the hype it got from actual adults when it was mainstream.\n\nIf you could have any superpower, what would it be and why? (only basic people say flying)\n\nI would definitely read minds because I think most of my questions about life\/people would be answered.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
