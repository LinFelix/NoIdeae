Nothing else has worked,\" he said.\n\n\"Let's try the opposite. That will hopefully give the North Korean leader the sense that the US is not after regime change, as he has seen in the past, and in exchange, cease any further nuclear and missile testing, \"he said.\n\nMaloof said last year and earlier this year, before the recent \"resurrection of a lot of military bluster by the US\", Trump had suggested talking to the North Korean leader over a hamburger.\n\n\"President Trump suggested what amounts to a hamburger summit; to sit down with Kim Jong-un and talk ... This has not been tried before. Direct talks ought to tried ... I don't see why that doesn't occur, \" he asked.\n\n\"The UN has actually said it would sponsor such a gathering,\" he said.\n\nMaloof warned against the other options on the table.\n\nThe veteran analyst said that \"a military option would be catastrophic\".","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
