It will remain open until December 2 before moving to London.\n\nMcDermott and McGough, who have collaborated as artists since 1980, began their careers by living as if it were 1890, taking electricity and gas out of their apartment, and wearing starched collars.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
