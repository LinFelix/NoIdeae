Whether it be with nerves, handling money, cooking those student meals, relationships, not coping or indeed anything you ever have a question about take the first step towards getting an answer by 'asking it'.\n\nDavid Lewis, head of employment law, Howells Solicitors, Newport\n\nLooking back at university, I realise now that the academic element is only a part of the value of a degree and of going to university. Being forced to fend for myself properly for the first time, organise my life, apply myself in the right areas and strike a balance between lectures and a social life was as important a life lesson as I ever had. My advice therefore would be work hard but enjoy yourself; immerse yourself in university life and realise that being a student is one of those periods of life you'll hark back to for years to come once you're in full time work so make the most of it. And finally... don't ever reference Wikipedia in your essays!\n\nDan Smith, director, M4 Property Consultants, Newport\n\nUniversity isn't for everyone and we think it is important these days for young people to consider whether it is the right decision for them or whether something like an apprenticeship or on the job training would be more suited to their learning style and aspirations. However, for those who do go to university it is a great opportunity to get some excellent life experience. For many students this may be their first time living away from their parents. Developing their independence, ability to look after themselves, managing their time between studies \/ part time work and socialising, interacting with different groups of people are all key skills that will be considered by future employers. It's a great opportunity to learn life skills and was a develop academically. It's also a great opportunity to have lots of fun! That's the most important thing. Find something you enjoy and whether it university or a career later on, it will be a lot easier if you enjoy what you're doing every day.\n\nCatherine Lindsay, sales and lettings administrator, Kingston Newell Estate Agents, Newport\n\nIt's been a year since I graduated, so my advice to anyone starting uni would be - enjoy yourself. Seriously. Work hard by all means, but that can't be the be-all and end-all of your university experience. Also the slog of working 9-to-5 once it's over will hit you like a freight train, so enjoy every second of freedom you get! The friends and memories you make will be worth more to you than the piece of paper at the end.\n\nSara Uren, senior associate, Harding Evans Solicitors, Newport\n\nUniversity is a great opportunity to meet new people. Joining various social or sport clubs is a good start. It can be a little daunting starting your course and you need to make sure it's the right fit for you. Your course tutors have a wealth of experience between them so if you have any concerns or queries, don't be afraid to ask for any advice. The summer is also a great chance to get some practical work experience before getting a full time job after university. But above all else, enjoy!","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
