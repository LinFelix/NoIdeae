- The 'singularity' event that scientists talk about in artificial intelligence (AI) -- when robots would outsmart human beings in reasoning -- has just been moved up, according to a top scientist at HP Inc.\n\nThe progress in AI and machine learning has been so rapid that scientists have upped the estimate for the 'singularity' to happen in 2029 from 2040, shaving off 11 years of development time, says Shane Wall, Chief Technology Officer at HP, who also heads the HP Labs which is at the centre of innovation within the company.\n\nWall said there may be some who watch with fear for that event to happen but taken adequate precautions, this change would bring in much good for everyone -- be it in manufacturing, health, innovation or elsewhere.\n\nHe said AI handles a huge amount of data and can discern patterns to take decisions. \"Machine learning uses AI and big data to learn and it can find things that no humans can see,\" Wall noted.\n\nAccording to him, already there are massive data farms which are crunching big numbers and there are research labs and companies where machines are taught how to use data to managing things around us.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
