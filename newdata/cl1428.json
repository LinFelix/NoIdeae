I therefore plead with him to ignore the ranting, destructive criticism and derailing insults passed on him by the workers of the university and assume the status of an elder statesman which he actually is, to join forces with all the critical stakeholders to put a final match on the age long and perennial crisis of LAUTECH, it is within his ambit and landscape to achieve the unusual in this circumstance\"\n\nThe former president of the alumni association commended the governors of Oyo and Osun states, Senator Abiola Ajimobi and Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola for the victorious battle of survival and continuous stability in fulfilling the statutory obligations in their supervisory roles as visitors to the university, adding that they have once again demonstrated the patriotic zeal and philosophy of accountability and transparency in blocking leakages and fighting the scourge of corruption through the KPMG auditing processes of world best practices for sustainability and financial management.\n\n\"As a former council member, I can authoritatively say that LAUTECH has the potential capacity to sustain itself through creative mechanism and ingenuity drive on the path of the management to drive effective and transformational policies which can birth the increase in internally generated revenue, how I wish the present crop of officials can look inwards and diversify through various means available and applicable. The area of agriculture is fundamental as the university has a large expanse of land to the tune of 140,000 hectares which can bring in good fortunes in financial prosperity and serve as a research model for agro-allied conglomerate\"\n\n\"One must also salute the uncompromising resilience and doggedness of the cerebral and quintessential chairman of the council who incidentally is a foundational apostle of the LAUTECH project, Prof Oladapo Afolabi and his entire team for the active roles and complementary efforts rendered so far to arrest this ugly ravaging storm of the management\/workers faceoff. Their uncommon approach with absolute sincerity and re-energized vigour to reposition our university is unique and worth commending. I also sympathize with parents and guardians most especially the students who have been at the negative receiving end of the strike, they have paid the greatest sacrifice in preferring the lasting solution which is in sight as their resumption beacons.\n\n\"My ultimate appeal is to the labour unions (ASUU, NAAT, NASU and SSANU) to come to realistic terms with the government and management in their demands, as the economic templates and realities in the country is visible and the financial contents therein encourages prudency in management of scarce and unavailable resources. It is a hard knock truth that all their demands cannot be met; hence they should always consider the future of students in their subsequent confrontation. I advise them to embrace more of dialogue and consultation in advancing their request. More pathetic is the loss of time they have subjected the students to, active for four months and yet will be remunerated for the twelve months, who will pay for the unrecoverable amount of months the students were idle?\n\n\"Lastly, we should all partner and collaborate with one another to ensure the smooth and operational running of the university, this is a landmark task that must be accomplished by all stakeholders which has the traditional and religious institution, community leaders and host community, alumni association, labour unions, governing council, parents and students, government and the management. I strongly believe and confess that LAUTECH will be great again and the dreams and vision of the founding members will not die untimely,\" Alawode concluded.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
