The site will also include 8,500 temporary toilets and 14 warehouses to store aid and provisions.\n\nRohingya refugees - in pictures 15 show all Rohingya refugees - in pictures 1\/15\n\nA young girl and a baby wade through mud after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh from Burma on 10 September\n\nDan Kitwood\/Getty Images\n\n2\/15\n\nRohingya refugees walk through a camp in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh after arriving from Burma\n\nDan Kitwood\/Getty Images\n\n3\/15\n\nA young Rohingya refugee gathers firewood after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh from Burma\n\nDan Kitwood\/Getty Images\n\n4\/15\n\nRohingya refugees wait for sacks of rice to be distributed in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh\n\nDan Kitwood\/Getty Images\n\n5\/15\n\nRohingya Muslim refugees arrive on a boat in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh after crossing from Burma on 8 September\n\nDan Kitwood\/Getty Images\n\n6\/15\n\nRohingya Muslim refugees react after being re-united with each other after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh on a boat from Burma\n\nGetty\n\n7\/15\n\nRohingya Muslim refugees walk along the remains of a road after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh on a boat from Burma\n\nDan Kitwood\/Getty Images\n\n8\/15\n\nRohingya Muslim refugees wade through water after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh by boat from Burma\n\nDan Kitwood\/Getty Images\n\n9\/15\n\nRohingya Muslim refugees wade through water after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh by boat from Myanmar\n\nDan Kitwood\/Getty Images\n\n10\/15\n\nRohingya Muslim refugees stand in the rain after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh by boat from Burma\n\nDan Kitwood\/Getty Images\n\n11\/15\n\nIndian children hold placards and shout slogans during a protest against the alleged persecution of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma\n\nEPA\/Raminder Pal Singh\n\n12\/15\n\nSupporters of the Difa-e-Pakistan Council (DPC), an Islamic organisation, listen to their leaders' speeches against Burma's persecution of Rohingya Muslims, during a demonstration in Karachi\n\nReuters\/Akhtar Soomro\n\n13\/15\n\nHundreds of Iranians take part in a protest against violence in Myanmar after weekly Friday prayers, in Tehran\n\nEPA\/Abedin Taherkenareh\n\n14\/15\n\nIndonesian Muslim activists hold placards and shout slogans during a protest against the alleged persecution of the Rohingya minority in Magelang, Central Java, Indonesia\n\nEPA\/Ali Lutfi\n\n15\/15\n\nMembers of an Islamic organisation shout slogans against the Burma government during a protest in Dhaka, Bangladesh\n\nEPA\/Abir Abdullah\n\nHowever, the government also plans to impose a number of harsh restrictions on the inhabitants of the shelter.\n\nLast week, Bangladeshi Home Affairs Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said inhabitants would be forbidden to leave the camp and also prohibited from travelling across the country by vehicle.\n\nThe current crisis in Rakhine State began in late August, when an insurgent Rohingya group attacked a police outpost.\n\nThis prompted Burma's military to launch \"clearance operations\" against the rebels, setting off a wave of violence that has left hundreds dead, and tens of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh.\n\nRohingya crisis: Muslim village burnt to the ground\n\nThe army has been accused of using scored-earth tactics to expel Rohingya from the area. Fire-detection data and satellite imagery shows at least 80 large-scale fires in inhabited areas across northern Rakhine State since 25 August, according to Amnesty International.\n\nTirana Hassan, Amnesty International's Crisis Response Director, said:\"There is a clear and systematic pattern of abuse here. Security forces surround a village, shoot people fleeing in panic and then torch houses to the ground.\n\n\"In legal terms, these are crimes against humanity - systematic attacks and forcible deportation of civilians\"\n\nThe UN's High Commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, has also said the military's assault was \"a textbook example of ethnic cleansing and a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return.\"\n\nMore about: Rohingya crisis Burma Refugees ethnic cleansing Reuse content","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
