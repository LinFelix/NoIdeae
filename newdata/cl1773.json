The group held its first meeting Sept. 7 to sign a petition and discuss its next moves.\n\nThe city code requires noise stays under certain decibel levels, but part of the problem, residents say, is the motorcycles are gone before police can come to the area to measure the noise. Residents complain motorcycles rev the engines, speed, and have altered them to create amplified noise.\n\nJaci Johnson, who lives in the Buckhead Forest neighborhood, is helping lead the group and hopes to get the noise ordinance enforced or changed if it is unenforceable. Johnson said about 10 people came to the meeting, which she said was a disappointing turnout.\n\nHowever, they are distributing a petition to send to city councilmembers and Zone 2 of the Atlanta Police Department. They will also speak at the Sept. 18 city council meeting and they hope to present audio of what they say is unreasonable motorcycle noise.\n\nJohnson said they hope to receive at least 100 signatures. The petition calls for more consistent enforcement of the noise ordinance. Johnson said her group is happy to have Shook's support to fix the noise ordinance, and would provide community support if he contacted them. So far, their emails to him have gone unanswered, she said.\n\n\"We appreciate his action, and if he wants support I would think he would reach out to the community,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson acknowledged problems with noise and the ordinance are not new, and wonders why the city has not been more motivated to enforce it.\n\n\"I know it has a history here. It's an ongoing problem and it hasn't been addressed, maybe because the funding or the will isn't there,\" she said.\n\nMotorcycles are tricky, Shook said, because they produce a loud noise, but are still legal unless it can be proven they are altered to be louder.\n\n\"It's not illegal to ride a motorcycle. Unless you can prove they are intentionally doing it, you aren't going to win a case in court,\" Shook said. \"There are no enforceable laws to use.\"\n\nStill, Shook hopes to find a solution to this ongoing problem and overall problems with a lack of enforcement of the noise ordinance, he said.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
