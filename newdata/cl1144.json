It's beyond 'S.N.L.'\" She also pulled a passage from George Orwell's \"1984\" (and plastered it across the gallery's floor) and contributed a lot of her own text, some in German.\n\n\"Forever\" caps a busy summer for Kruger -- it was just announced that she'll collaborate with Performa for its November biennial -- in a bustling political landscape. Still, her mandate remains the same: \"I'm an artist who works with pictures and words, and tries to make meaning around things that engage me,\" she said. As for the rest of us: \"I think it's important to be vigilant and understand how power is driven through culture. It's nice to know who's effing you when you're being effed.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
