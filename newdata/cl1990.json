Christhurajah, who has been out on bail since February, was found guilty by another jury in May.\n\nWedge said the evidence showed Christhurajah was not out to make a profit but was one of the owners of the ship, was involved in arranging accommodation for some migrants in Thailand and also used a false name to conceal his identity.\n\nHe provided migrants with bus tickets to get to Thailand, where they boarded the MV Sun Sea, and was seen using a satellite phone on the ship, she said, adding that while the evidence suggests money changed hands, there's nothing to suggest Christhurajah received any of it.\n\nThe Crown asked for an additional 11 years behind bars after time already served, saying the smugglers preyed on desperate people who paid thousands of dollars to escape Sri Lanka after a civil war that ended in 2009 when the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were defeated by government forces.\n\nWedge cited several letters of reference on Christhurajah's behalf from people who had extensive contact with him while he was detained at the Fraser Regional Correctional Centre in Maple Ridge, B.C.\n\nShe said they all establish there's virtually no risk of Christhurajah reoffending and that his character and conduct suggest he was a model prisoner.\n\nA chaplain said in a letter that he spent hundreds of hours speaking with Christhurajah and people he interacted over seven years, and also observed the man's behaviour and attitudes.\n\nA worker with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which checks detention conditions and communicates with detainees, described Christhurajah as a \"gentle, hard-working and articulate man\" who was repeatedly identified as the most responsible participant in a work program at the facility, Wedge told the court.\n\nShe said the worker wrote that Christhurajah's most troubling concern was about his wife and child, adding he had no contact with his daughter for the first six months of her life.\n\nChristhurajah and his lawyer, Casey Leggett, declined to comment outside court.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
