Organizers, on the event's website, appealed for people to \"help send a message to Congress, the media & the world\" that \"we stand united to defend American culture & values.\"\n\nThe pitch to would-be participants: \"If you stand for patriotism and freedom, this rally is for you!\"\n\nTrump was spending the weekend at his golf club in New Jersey before attending the U.N. General Assembly next week.\n\nLater, in front of the Lincoln Memorial, thousands of juggalos, as supporters of the rap group Insane Clown Posse are known, readied for a concert and rally. They intended to push their demand that the FBI rescind its classification of juggalos as a \"loosely organized hybrid gang.\"\n\nThe rap duo has developed an intensely devoted fan base over the course of a 25-year career.\n\nA 2011 report by the Justice Department's Gang Task Force placed the juggalos, who favor extensive tattoos and outlandish face paint, in the same classification as overtly violent gangs such as the Bloods and the Crips.\n\nThe rap group and its fans claim to be a nonviolent community subject to largely class-based discrimination by law enforcement. The band, along with the ACLU, sued the FBI in 2014 seeking to change the classification but with little success so far.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ashraf Khalil on Twitter at
