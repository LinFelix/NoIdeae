She was then barely 17years old then.\n\nAccording to Adegoke, Oginni and her likes deserve to be celebrated. \"In an era when culture of hard work is fast eroding among the youths, outstanding young men and women like Folafoluwa deserve to be celebrated and advertised to the whole world, instead of the demoralising negative stories we always hear and read about our country\", Adegoke remarked.\n\n\"I am particularly elated to learn that the young girl is from Osun. I am happy that she has done us proud in Osun. But I wonder why her feats are not given such a wide publicity by the media, unlike when it is reported that some youths commit some heinous crimes\", the legal luminary lamented.\n\n\"I congratulate the girls parents, the management of her former schools in Osogbo and the university where she has achieved this rare feat.\n\n\"Because I am particularly interested in the quality of education of my society, I have a mission to create the enabling academic environment that will produce, promote and reward many Folafoluwas in our schools in Osun when I am voted as governor of the State\", the governorship hopeful promised.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
