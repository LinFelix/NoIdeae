I am already aware of inventions such as an Automated Pop-Up Target System, a Multi-Purpose Combat Mobile Robot, and a Perimeter Surveillance Robot, which the NDA has showcased at various science and technology exhibitions in the recent past.\n\n\"This is laudable and I urge you to sustain the culture. I would also like to urge you to collaborate more extensively with the private sector, for research and innovation. All around the country, technology hubs are springing up and are attracting our country's brightest talent, and breaking new technological ground. I am convinced that the military should make its presence felt in this area,\" he said.\n\nMr. Buhari advised the military to explore more scientific ways of dealing with current security challenges.\n\nHe commended the Nigerian military for decimating the Boko Haram terrorist group that was hitherto a problem in the North-east zone of the country.\n\n\"The world has changed a great deal in the time since today's graduating classes enrolled into the NDA. The threats that confront us a nation and as a planet have evolved and continue to evolve.\n\n\"It feels like yesterday when the earliest high-profile Boko Haram suicide bombings happened in Nigeria - if I recall correctly, the bombing of the Police Headquarters in Abuja was the first major incident to hit the national consciousness. It was a surreal moment, something that no one associated with Nigeria.\n\n\"And again very quickly we started to see a trend of female suicide bombers. This swift evolution in suicide bombings is a perfect illustration of the nature of the threats that nations face today. This is, therefore, the question we ought to be asking ourselves: are our Armed Forces evolving with a similar speed and urgency?\" he asked.\n\n689 cadets graduated at the event, which was attended by service chiefs, governors and traditional rulers among others.\n\nThe highpoint of the event was the presentation of awards by the representative of Mr. Buhari, where Cadet A. B. Bature emerged the overall best in both military and academic exercises.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
