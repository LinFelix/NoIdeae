My bathroom window faces a brick wall of another apartment building three feet away. I would like to paint the brick outside my window with a simple white wash to allow more reflected light into my bathroom. Since the other building has no windows or doors on that side, no one would ever see the paint. But could doing this damage the brick? Could I get in trouble?\n\nA: You cannot paint someone else's property without permission, even if no one ever finds out about it. You don't own the wall, so you don't have the right to alter it. And yes, you could get in trouble.\n\n\"It would constitute a trespass and also could damage your neighbor's wall, exposing you to liability for money damages,\" said Ingrid C. Manevitz, a real estate lawyer and a partner at the Manhattan law firm Schwartz Sladkus Reich Greenberg Atlas.\n\nYour neighbor could sue for damages and press criminal charges for vandalism.\n\nSo put away your paintbrush and consider some legal solutions to this common, albeit unsightly, New York City vista. You could start by asking the neighboring building if it would grant you permission to paint the wall. Management would probably say no, but it's worth a shot.\n\nAssuming your request is denied, other options await. To improve the view, you could affix privacy film, a decorative decal, to the window. These decals can be cut to size and stick onto the glass. Light could still get through the decal, but you could obscure the brick with a whimsical design, like bamboo shoots. As a more permanent solution, you could replace the windowpane with etched glass, an option that would require your co-op board's approval. Or simply hang a pane of etched or stained glass in front of the existing window, a fix that would not require the board's permission.\n\nRather than focus on the window, redirect your gaze to a different wall. Jill Vegas, an interior decorator and the author of \"Speed Decorating\" (Taunton Press, 2009), suggests adding a decorative mirror, or a wall of mirrors, to bring light into the room and \"create a focal point that is beautiful and inviting so you're not tunnel-visioning into this eyesore.\" Maybe, with something pretty to look at, the brick wall won't seem like such a flaw anymore.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
