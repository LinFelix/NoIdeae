The Ethiopian capital also hosts more than 100 embassies and consulates.\n\nWith its Addis Ababa office, AlJazeera is expected to expand its coverage of Africa in general and East Africa in particular. Mohammed Tewekel is one of the few experts in the politics of the region as well as its diplomatic history. His networks cover the Middle East and the Horn of Africa region and Turkey.\n\nIn a telephone conversation with Gedab News, Tewekel said, \"besides its usual political and development news, Al Jazeera will cover African culture news and contribute in its promotion.\"\n\nWhen asked about Aljazeera general task, Tewekel said, \"though Al Jazeera is relatively young compared to renowned news institutions, it has made its presence known all over the world and has contributed greatly in increasing the awareness of the people of the region regarding developments that affect their lives.\"\n\nGedab News congratulated Mr. Tewekel and wishes him a successful career with Al Jazeera, and welcomes Al Jazeera to the Horn of Africa region to play its journalistic role.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
