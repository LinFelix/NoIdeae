Barbara Flynn Currie has been the top lieutenant to House Speaker Michael Madigan in her role as majority leader in the Illinois House.\n\nThat is now coming to an end as the Chicago Democrat added her name to a growing list of state lawmakers who are opting to retire from the General Assembly rather than run for re-election.\n\nUnlike some of the others, though, Currie said the more highly charged partisan atmosphere in Illinois state government isn't part of the decision.\n\n\"In terms of relationships with people, what I will miss most about Springfield are the people,\" Currie said. \"I will miss my friends, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the House and in the Senate. That's not why I'm leaving. I'm leaving because I think it is time for me to consider other challenges, other opportunities.\"\n\nThat will include continuing to speak out on behalf of issues that she's supported during her tenure in the legislature, like criminal justice reform, women's rights in the workplace, human services and the environment.\n\nCurrie, 77, acknowledged that the legislature's schedule in recent years, when sessions have run into overtime and lawmakers have been repeatedly called back into session, has been difficult.\n\n\"For me, the fact that our schedules have been so topsy-turvy made it a little more difficult to stay on top,\" she said.\n\nCurrie was first elected to the House in 1978 from the Hyde Park neighborhood in Chicago. She was named House majority leader in 1997 to replace former Rep. Jim McPike of Alton. At the time, it was considered out of the norm that a woman would be appointed to the post.\n\n\"I think everyone was quite surprised that a woman was asked to fill the role,\" Currie said. \"I think they assumed it would be a downstater, everybody assumed it would be someone white and male.\"\n\nBy the time she was appointed, though, Currie had already been in the House for 20 years and gained experience that helped in the majority leader position.\n\n\"I was used to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I was used to trying to find compromise, trying to help people make sense of the legislation they were pursuing,\" she said. \"I think that served me well, so once I was there, people were not uncomfortable with me, even though I was unexpected.\"\n\nIn a statement, Madigan thanked Currie for her service.\n\n\"Barbara Currie has tackled many, many complex issues with a keen intellect, fairness and balance,\" Madigan said. \"I am grateful for her contributions and I look forward to counting on her counsel as we go forward.\"\n\nThe Illinois Republican Party said Currie's decision not to run for reelection is another sign that Madigan's name is \"toxic\" in Illinois politics.\n\n\"Leader Currie ... garnered respect from both sides of the aisle throughout her career, but her shocking departure is a bad omen for Democrats,\" the party said in a statement. \"Currie was through of as a possible successor to Mike Madigan's record-breaking speakership. Everyone, particularly House Democrats, know Speaker Madigan is toxic.\"\n\nCurrie dismissed the idea that Madigan is toxic as \"completely a misunderstanding, a complete misapprehension.\"\n\n\"I have enjoyed very much the opportunity to work with Speaker Madigan, I admire him, I like him,\" Currie said. \"One of the things I will miss about the assembly is not continuing that relationship with him and with so many of my other colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers.\"\n\nOne of the biggest changes Currie said she's seen during her time in the legislature is the increasing number of women elected to office.\n\n\"We haven't got to equity yet, but we certainly are increasing our numbers and I think that is an encouraging thing,\" she said. \"I think that speaks well not only of the women who are winning, but to the electorate that is choosing them.\"\n\nAs majority leader, Currie was called upon to shepherd many complex and controversial issues through the House over the years. Consequently, she would not single out one achievement that stood above the rest. However, she did say that recently she was proud of the school funding reform legislation that was passed, having chaired a House task force on the issue for the past two years.\n\nCurrie also said she's comfortable that her departure at the end of 2018 won't leave the issues she cares about without a voice.\n\n\"I leave knowing there is a crop of terrific people ready to carry the agenda that I've been working on these many years,\" she said. \"I feel good the issues I care about are not going to disappear from the face of the Springfield scene.\"\n\nContact Doug Finke:
