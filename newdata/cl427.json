The previous government was felled by the\nPanama Papers scandal over offshore tax havens.\n\"We have lost the majority and I don't see anything that\nindicates we can regain that. I am calling an election,\"\nBenediktsson told reporters.\nHe said he would be looking to hold the election in November\nthough that would mean it would not be possible to finish next\nyear's budget.\nIt is ultimately up to President Gudni Johannesson, whom\nBenediktsson will meet with on Saturday, to make the decision on\na new election.\nIf he accepts the call for an election he is likely to ask\nthe government to stay in place until a new coalition is formed\nbut he could also ask other parties to try form a majority.\nJohannesson was not immediately available for comment.\nThe news knocked more than 1 percent off the value of the\nIcelandic crown against the euro and the dollar\n.\nThe scandal revolves around a letter written by\nBenediktsson's father to help an old friend have his criminal\nrecord expunged after he was convicted of sex offences against\nchildren.\n\"The board of Bright Future has decided to terminate\ncooperation with the government of Bjarni Benediktsson,\" the\nparty said in a statement. \"The reason for the split is a\nserious breach of trust within the government.\"\nThe Ministry of Justice, under Sigridur Andersen, a member\nof Benediktsson's Independence Party, initially refused to\ndisclose who had written the letter of recommendation. She was\nlater ordered to do so by a parliamentary committee.\nAndersen told broadcaster Stod 2 that she had informed\nBenediktsson about his father's involvement in July but had not\ntold anyone else.\n\"I was told by the justice minister that we were discussing\nconfidential matters, which followed the rules of the\nministry...I decided to handle the issue as a confidential\nmatter,\" Benediktsson said.\nHe had later informed the chairmen of the coalition parties,\nhe said.\n\"First, it was illegal for me to indulge the information,\nsecond, I informed them when I could.\"\nThe prime minister's father, Benedikt Sveinsson, confirmed\non Friday that he had signed a letter supporting his friend's\napplication to have his \"honour restored\", a procedure that\neffectively erases a criminal record. Among the requirements is\na letter of recommendation from a close friend or associate.\nSveinsson said he had not discussed the letter with anyone.\n\"This week, it came forth that my father had written a\nletter... I couldn't have written such a letter myself and I\nwill never try to defend that,\" Bendiktsson told a news\nconference.\nCapital Economics economist Stephen Brown said a change of\ngovernment could frustrate plans to overhaul Iceland's monetary\npolicy framework. Benediktsson's administration has asked\nexperts to look at options, including pegging the crown to the\neuro or the pound to keep sharp shifts in the currency from\ndestabilising the economy.\nThe central bank cut interest rates four times in the year\nto June to tame the crown. The currency has soared on the back\nof a tourism boom that has helped the economy recover from years\nof crisis but increased the risks of overheating. The strong\ncurrency is also hurting Iceland's exports.\n\"I think if there's going to be another election and\npossibly the chance of a more left-wing government, then that\nprobably decreases the chance of monetary policy being loosened\nany further in the future,\" Brown said.\n\"That could be quite important.\"\n(Reporting by Elias Thorsson in Reykjavik, additional reporting\nby Julie Astrid
