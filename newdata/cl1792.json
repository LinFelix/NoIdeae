I remember looking out of the window and feeling very excited about this new adventure. This is something that still excites me to this day, the infinite possibilities and adventures of life.\n\nMost frequented restaurant and absolute favourite dish? What food would you really turn your nose up to?\n\nI love Peruvian food and especially the fresh tastes of ceviche and we are lucky in London to have some amazing Peruvian restaurants. I absolutely despise liver.\n\nWhat did you have for breakfast?\n\nMy breakfast consists of either porridge with oat milk and blueberries or Greek yoghurt with home made granola and berries\n\nWould you class yourself as a day or night person? What's your idea of the perfect night\/day out?\n\nAlthough I don't like getting up too early I think I have now become more of a day person than a night person. I seem to get a lot more done and the days are more productive. I still love a night out though. A perfect day would always include friends and a meal somewhere, preferably outside (by the sea, in the mountains or even in a park).\n\nBest book ever read?\n\nI love reading and try to read as much as I can, so this is a very difficult question but I think Shantaram by David Gregory Roberts is a book that left its mark on me. Beautiful descriptions of India and its people, it is a story about love and forgiveness and one man's searing search for redemption.\n\nFavourite film of all time?\n\nGuess Who's Coming to Dinner with Spencer Tracy, Sidney Poitier and Katherine Hepburn. I love films that are based in reality and everyday human interaction and events. The film contains a (then rare) positive representation of society's perceived controversial issues with interracial marriage.\n\nFavourite holiday destination? What's your dream trip?\n\nNaturally I love coming back to Cyprus. But otherwise the two places on the top of my list are Italy and India. Having been to Italy on a number of occasions the beauty, the history and the food never cease to amaze. And of course India is a place I totally fell in love with. Apart from the yoga connection the diversity of the country is amazing. The vibrant colours, the raw beauty, the intense smells of spices and the forever smiling people made me want to go back again and again. My dream trip is to travel around Canada for at least a month with my husband.\n\nWhat music are you listening to in the car at the moment?\n\nIt depends on my mood. Listening to BBC radio 2 is an easy one but I love all types of music, even though I am going through a bit of a country music phase at the moment!\n\nWhat is always in your fridge?\n\nFresh vegetables and salads, oat milk and berries. As well as dark chocolate and wine.\n\nDream house: rural retreat or urban dwelling? Where would it be, what would it be like?\n\nMy dream house would be by the beach with massive glass doors opening out to the sea and the horizon. I love the sea and the energy it provides.\n\nIf you could pick anyone at all (alive or dead) to go out for the evening with, who would it be?\n\nAlthough it might sound a bit clich√© I would love to meet the Dalai Lama. I once saw an interview with him and Joanna Lumley and he came across, apart from being a very spititual, grounded and wise human being, as a person with a lovely sense of humour and a positive outlook on life. A person that believes that with love we can overcome everything. The greatest single thing in life, he says, is the intelligence of human beings. \"With the help of human intelligence, we have the ability to develop infinite love and infinite compassion.\"\n\nIf the world is ending in 24 hours what would you do?\n\nI would have a party and invite all my loved ones and make sure they know how much they mean to me.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nSnakes\n\nTell me a joke...\n\nUsing a toilet on an aeroplane means I'm now certified to teach yoga! Sorry I know that is terrible\n\nLondon-based yoga instructor Francesca will be on the island to lead four Okram and Ashtanga Yoga workshops at the Hamam in Nicosia on September 18 and 25","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
