These are sick and demented\npeople who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be\nproactive!\"\nHis comments appeared to point the finger at British police.\nAsked whether Trump knew something Britain did not, May said: \"I\nnever think it's helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an\nongoing investigation\".\nOthers chimed in, with May's former chief of staff, Nick\nTimothy, saying Trump's comment was \"so unhelpful from leader of\nour ally and intelligence partner\".\nLondon and Washington have long boasted of their \"special\nrelationship\", close ties that were strained earlier this year\nwhen the United States leaked information on an investigation\ninto a bomber who killed 22 at a Manchester pop concert.\nTrump told reporters after his tweet that he had been\nbriefed on the London incident, and he also said he would be\nspeaking with May, although it was not clear whether his\nreference to Scotland Yard came up on the call.\nA senior U.S. government official cast doubt on whether\nTrump was privy to information over whether the bomber in the\nwest London attack was known or not.\nThe official said that at this point, U.S. agencies had no\ninformation to back up any suggestion by Trump that Britain had\nadvance warning or specific intelligence on the attack.\nAt a White House briefing ahead of next week’s U.N. General\nAssembly meeting, Trump’s national security adviser, H.R.\nMcMaster, said the president was referring generically to\nBritish efforts to combat terrorism and was not making a\nreference to any specific knowledge authorities in London may\nhave had.\n\"I think he means generally that this kind of activity is\nwhat we're trying to prevent, and so these organizations that\nare responsible for it, whatever comes out of this\ninvestigation, that remains to be seen,\" McMaster said.\nHours after Trump's tweet, Sky News cited security sources\nas saying they had identified a suspect in the attack, with the\nhelp of surveillance footage.\n(Reporting by Elizabeth Piper, William James and Mark\nHosenball; Additional reporting by Jeff Mason in Washington;\nEditing by Guy Faulconbridge and
