We need to collaborate with good understanding,\" Zaw Htay told Reuters.\nBangladesh has for decades faced influxes of Rohingya fleeing persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where the Rohingya are regarded as illegal migrants and denied citizenship.\nBangladesh was already home to 400,000 Rohingya before the latest crisis erupted on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked about 30 police posts and an army camp, killing a dozen people.\nThe Myanmar security forces responded with what rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say is a campaign of violence and arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population.\n\nHUMANITARIAN CRISIS\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. Security Council have urged Myanmar to end the violence, which he said was best described as ethnic cleansing.      \nMyanmar rejects the accusations, saying its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against the insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which claimed responsibility for the Aug. 25 attacks and similar, though smaller, attacks in October.\nThe government has declared ARSA a terrorist organisation and accused it of setting the fires and attacking civilians.\nAbout 30,000 non-Muslim villagers have also been displaced in the conflict in which Myanmar says more than 430 people have been killed, most of them insurgents. \nNearly half of 471 villages in the north of its Rakhine State had been completely deserted or partly abandoned, the government said.\nThe ARSA has denied links to foreign Islamists and has called for neighboring countries to block any foreign \"terrorists\" from trying to join it. It says it is fighting for the rights of Rohingya.\nThe conflict has led to a humanitarian crisis on both sides of the border and raised questions about Myanmar's transition under the leadership of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi after nearly 50 years of strict military rule.\nThe generals still control national security policy but nevertheless, Suu Kyi has been widely criticized abroad for not stopping or condemning the violence. \nThere is little sympathy for Rohingya in a country where the end of military rule has unleashed some old communal animosities and the military campaign in Rakhine State is generally supported.\nEthnic cleansing is not recognized as a separate crime under international law but allegations of ethnic cleansing as part of wider, systematic human rights violations have been heard in international courts.\nRights group Amnesty International said on Friday evidence pointed to a \"mass-scale scorched-earth campaign\" across the north of Rakhine that was unmistakably ethnic cleansing. \n\n (Additional reporting by Shoon Naing in YANGON; Writing by Robert Birsel; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
