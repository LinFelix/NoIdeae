What about 10 years down the line? Twenty?\n\nAnd the most important inquiry: What do you think?\n\nThere isn't a table big enough for everyone CU is inviting to weigh in on the university's future to have a seat, so CU is rolling out their Academic Futures plan incrementally. A series of town halls, campus representatives, and calls for written, bold ideas are intended to guide the campus on its path to giving the heave-ho to the way things have always been done and dreaming up innovative ways of moving forward.\n\n\"There seems to be a real appetite and renewed spirit for having discussions across schools,\" said Provost Russell Moore, who is leading the charge along with Chief Financial Officer Kelly Fox. \"This is an opportunity for the whole campus to get together and talk about our aspirations.\"\n\nA process consisting of multiple deadlines and benchmarks resulting in a final report from the provost in April of 2018 is already underway and has been on the administration's brain for years, Moore said.\n\nTown halls are being held across campus where students, staff, faculty and the community are invited to come ask questions and share their ideas to better influence more focused conversations from October through December. The next three are Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\nAt a Thursday town hall in the campus' Discovery Learning Center, a handful of people showed up to learn more about the Academic Futures plan and pitch suggestions, asking conversation facilitators if their ideas were what the campus had in mind.\n\n\"I know it sounds a little vague, abstract and maybe hard to get a handle on,\" said Jeff Cox, Vice Provost and Associate Vice Chancellor for Faculty Affairs, who was facilitating the conversation. \"But it's not abstract. It's about the stuff we do everyday.\"\n\nCox wanted to make a few things clear. The strategic vision for the university, Flagship 2030, remains unchanged. Also, Academic Futures is not a \"nuts and bolts operation.\"\n\n\"We're not talking about how to reorganize particular academic units,\" Cox told the town hall attendees. \"We're trying something a little different than other universities are doing.\"\n\nAs an example of the type of bold ideas CU is looking for, Cox shared one he'd heard at a previous town hall: abandoning the separate schools and colleges to focus more on interdisciplinary education. He and the university neither endorsed or dismissed this particular idea, but its ambitious nature was the kind of innovation CU wanted to hear.\n\n\"We really don't know what the end of this conversation will be,\" Cox said. \"We really don't have a secret plan.\"\n\nCU research assistant Stefano Maffei was one of about 10 who turned out for the informational town hall.\n\n\"There aren't a lot of people here,\" he said, gesturing around. He heard about the plan through word-of-mouth, but wanted to know how CU intended to hear from everyone without leaving folks out.\n\nThe plan, which is outlined online at colorado.edu\/academicfutures, has been blasted out in CU Boulder Today posts and emails from the provost. People or groups can request meetings through the website. Every chairman on campus should get an email asking them to set up a meeting to discuss the plan and spread the word to their colleagues. Student government organizations have been reached out to, Moore said.\n\n\"There is a problem getting the word out,\" Cox said. \"If there was a perfect mode of communicating with people, we'd all be doing it.\"\n\nAs of Thursday, 45 meetings were already being scheduled with people across campus, Moore said. Faculty, staff and student representatives called \"campus listeners\" were being nominated with 85 nominations so far.\n\n\"We're beginning to see a very specific increase to participate in this process,\" Moore said.\n\nIf interested parties can't make a meeting but still want to share their thoughts, they're encouraged to submit \"community white papers\" that will be posted on the website and used to inform conversations at future meetings. The ideas can be submitted anonymously -- a question one town hall attendee wanted to confirm, noting that some may fear their ideas would rattle cages in a way that could negatively impact the idea's author.\n\nCox assured him CU was serious about wanting a fresh perspective.\n\n\"This will end up being a prioritized list of projects set for the campus around learning and discovery about ideas, processes, aspirations that have arisen through this process that we want to accomplish and then a conversation about how to accomplish them,\" Cox said. \"Right now, we're doing the 'what' part, not the 'how' part.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
