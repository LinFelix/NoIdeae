Several\nhard-hit Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico and the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, suffered more than half the fatalities.\nFlorida Power &amp; Light, owned by NextEra Energy Inc\nand the state's biggest electric company, said it was working\naggressively to restore power to the 23 percent of its customers\nstill in the dark.\nThe utility has never before had to deal with a storm\naffecting its entire service territory, company spokesman Rob\nGould said.\n\"It will go down as one of the largest and most complex\nrestoration efforts in history,\" he said. \"Now we are literally\ninto the house-to-house combat mode.\"\nThe storm's death toll grew to at least 33 people in Florida\nafter a woman died of suspected carbon monoxide poisoning from a\ngenerator in Palm Beach County, the Palm Beach Post newspaper\nreported.\nA total of eight others died in Georgia and the Carolinas.\nNorth Carolina reported its first Irma death on Friday, saying a\nman there also had died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a\ngenerator.\nEight elderly people died earlier this week after being\nexposed to the heat inside a nursing home north of Miami that\nhad been left without full air conditioning after the hurricane\nhit.\nThe deaths at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills,\nnow under police and state investigation, stirred outrage over\nwhat many saw as a preventable tragedy and heightened concerns\nabout the vulnerability of the state's large elderly population\namid widespread, lingering power outages.\n\"The governor will continue to review all ways to ensure\ntragedies like this never happen again,\" Lauren Schenone, a\nspokeswoman for Florida Governor Rick Scott, said in a\nstatement.\nFlorida's healthcare agency ordered the nursing home on\nThursday to be suspended from the state Medicaid program. The\ncenter said it plans to the fight the state's efforts to shut it\ndown.\nA timeline of events issued by the nursing home shows\nadministrators repeatedly called Florida Power &amp; Light and state\nofficials after a transformer powering its air conditioning\nsystem went out during the storm on Sunday. The center said it\nwas informed that service would soon be fixed.\nNursing home operators had put out cooling units and fans in\nan effort to maintain reasonable temperatures and added\nadditional cooling units supplied by a hospital next door on\nTuesday.\nBut it was not until multiple patients began experiencing\nhealth emergencies, which promoted the evacuation of the center,\nthat the utility company arrived to make the repair, the nursing\nhome said.\nHowever, officials at the Florida Department of Health said\nthe facility did not indicate the extent of its problems nor\nrequested assistance in reports to a state monitoring database.\nIn its status reports, the center indicated that its cooling\nsystem was operational for much of the time, according to the\nstate.\n(Additional reporting by Letitia Stein in Detroit, Brendan\nO'Brien in Milwaukee, Scott DiSavino in New York and Colleen\nJenkins in North Carolina)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
