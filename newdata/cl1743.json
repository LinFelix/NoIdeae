The employee no longer works for PeaceHealth.\n\nPeaceHealth began sending out letters to the 1,969 affected patients on Monday.\n\n\"We sincerely apologize to patients for any concern or inconvenience this has caused,\" PeaceHealth officials said in a statement. \"Patient privacy is among our highest priorities at PeaceHealth, and we take this very seriously.\"\n\nIn a letter to affected patients, PeaceHealth encourages patients to remain vigilant against fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and free credit reports for unauthorized activity. The letter includes contact information and websites for credit reporting companies.\n\nPeaceHealth has also set up a call center to support patients. The call center, 888-449-6634, is open 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday.\n\nPeaceHealth is continuing to invest in technology and following best practices to monitor and safeguard patient information. In addition, the medical center is reinforcing staff education about the appropriate access of patient information, according to the statement.\n\nMarissa Harshman: 360-735-4546; marissa.harshman@columbian.com; twitter.com\/MarissaHarshman","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 19:55:23.603"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 19:55:23.284","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|Uo5ZwHZWfqXsZYNSp+HOPx6ePHA=|SrT9hlECV1VLluGAZb+Z2YxgE5tHETxEAvTFb+XEj6sZJW5\/aFOZmg==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":1,"name":"Health_Medical_Pharma"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/9a1a3098-e598-37b7-a5d7-9044557e71e7","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center","importance":"1","originalValue":"PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/99f3e117-f2bc-3f6b-96a6-7093c2b71ae3","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"PeaceHealth","importance":"1","originalValue":"PeaceHealth"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/5992277b-0e98-3f94-813b-84ec43607446","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Southwest Medical Center","importance":"1","originalValue":"Southwest Medical Center"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/107e68b0-f33b-34b5-8f7d-998d8a4dd350","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Health care","importance":"2","originalValue":"Health care"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/fd201584-004e-31c0-8121-b89bac98781b","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Identity theft","importance":"2","originalValue":"Identity theft"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/884106c3-2f6a-355f-bed4-c81a557638f1","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Medical privacy","importance":"2","originalValue":"Medical privacy"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/7":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/7","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/2fa315db-c00a-3f28-ae77-dc384fb66bec","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Health","importance":"2","originalValue":"Health"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/8":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/SocialTag\/8","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/ab9f217f-a2b9-3f0d-92a1-d9c63c80639e","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Law","importance":"2","originalValue":"Law"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/d265a1bd-a4ce-33d3-8676-3fbf6009971f\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Healthcare Facilities & Services -
