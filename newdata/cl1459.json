Among the qualities sought are outstanding moral character, personal and professional achievement, volunteerism and community involvement, and a strong overall commitment to mentoring young people.\n\nThe finalists are Matt Brown, Faith Gealey, Yentel McGaw, Alice Ramos and Stacie Sybersma.\n\nThe recipient of the award is asked to give generously of their time and talents to meet and speak to young people all over the islands. The 2016 YCLA recipient, Brianna Wilkerson, has spoken to thousands of young people during her year with her message of perseverance and pursuing one's passion with focus and determination.\n\nThe YCLA gala celebration will be held on Saturday, Nov. 4 at the Kimpton Seafire Resort + Spa and the recipient of the award will be revealed during a live broadcast online and on television.\n\nDirector of the Young Cayman Leaders Foundation, Chris Duggan, said attendees are in for a memorable evening as they celebrate the achievements, hard work and dedication of the finalists.\n\nMr. Duggan said: \"This long-standing programme wouldn't be possible without the support of our sponsors who provide an opportunity to show the country the fantastic young leadership in our midst. We are indebted to our loyal sponsors, who have made this a reality year after year.\"\n\nFaith Gealey, 34, is a community builder. Whether at home or at work, she brings people together. Faith works as a speech language pathologist at the Health Services Authority. She is a member of the board of the Special Needs Foundations and is a deputy chair of the Cayman Islands National Disabilities Council. She is also a founding member and the chair of the Caribbean Speech and Hearing Association. She is fluent in American sign language, skills she uses to help Cayman's deaf community.\n\nFaith is also one of the founding members of Cayman Thanksgiving. Her core message for Cayman's youth is that mentorship is your key to success. \"Actively seek mentorship in all areas of your life, and be open to the guidance you receive,\" she said.\n\nMatt Brown's personality seems to bridge all age barriers and shines light on Cayman's history and culture with his own unique sense of humour.\n\nAt Geezum TV, he developed his own media company and brand which has developed an animated children's show, Bobo & Teedee and comedy sketch variety show which is now carried by Tempo networks and is seen in over five million households. Matt, 32, is a gifted public speaker and talented performer.\n\nHe used his degree of professional recording arts and social studies to write and perform his own music, but is equally gifted on stage, receiving accolades for his work in the Cayman storytelling festival, Gimmistory and Rundown.\n\nMost recently, Matt was chosen to represent Cayman in theatre, playing the role in Dr. Frank McField's Playground at CARIFESTA 13 in Barbados.\n\nMatt's core message to the youth is: \"Don't dwell on the past, don't fear the future, happiness is in the present moment.\"\n\nAlice Ramos will spend an extra hour in the day when necessary to improve the lives of others through community service. One of her most proud positions in this regard was serving as president of Rotaract Blue Cayman Islands in 2015\/16 after moving up the club ranks in a variety of capacities. During her year as president, she created an initiative: Put your best foot forward. It was a programme that provided new school shoes for children coming from families facing financial difficulties.\n\nShe has been involved in many charitable efforts, including the Cayman Finance Student Education and World Experience Programme, raising money for Meals on Wheels, volunteering with Junior Achievement (and now serving on the board).\n\nIn her professional life, Alice, 29, started as an intern at DMS in 2004 and has worked her way up to a manager position in operations and redemptions at Saxon Pensions. She has received many awards and accolades and is a leader of the Saxon Investment Club.\n\nAlice's message to the youth is: \"Believe in yourself, you can achieve anything you set your mind to. Your age doesn't matter.\"\n\nYentel McGaw is renowned as a community leader and youth advocate through her years of service to the public. She is the immigration manager and HR consultant at Baraud International Recruitment Consultants with over four years' experience in the human resources field.\n\nYentel, 26, is passionate about helping the Caymanian community secure employment and received a great turnout of support having recently executed the Ritz-Carlton Caymanian Recruitment Drive in June.\n\nShe is a proud alumnus of Ernst and Young and the Ritz-Carlton, Grand Cayman where she spearheaded community initiatives and projects for each organisation. In 2009, Yentel founded the Youth Community Excellence Award programme which highlights the positive efforts of young people in the community who are striving to make a difference. She has organised initiatives such as a multi-hotel Earth Day Clean Up, an End Polio fundraiser with the Rotaract Club of Grand Cayman, assisted with food drives and mentored high school girls. Yentel's message to the youth is: \"Your character and reputation will often make the first impression long before someone meets you. It's the most important investment you can make in yourself to ensure you are nurturing and investing in your future.\"\n\nStacie Sybersma has a passion for the environment and in particular, the ocean and coastal zone. That passion has led her to tackle tough projects such as her master's thesis which looked at contamination from the land fill in George Town.\n\nStacie, 27, works at CUC as an environment, health and safety specialist. She also volunteers on the National Trust's\n\nEnvironmental Advisory Committee. She frequently volunteers to give lectures about Cayman's natural environment to local students. She has given two TedX talks and is a published writer and certified rescue diver.\n\n\"As a woman working in science I understand how intimidating it can be to pursue your dreams, and do what you love,\" is her message to the youth. \"However, don't let anyone or anything hold you back.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
