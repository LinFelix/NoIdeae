Young people will also have the opportunity to gain a national qualification by achieving an Arts Award.\n\nKirsty said the project has been going since February and has been a huge success.\n\n\"We have some amazingly, talented young people attending,\" she said.\n\n\"We had our first performance in July and we are now working towards our next show which will be on Sunday, December 10, at the Benn Hall in Rugby.\n\n\"This is a great opportunity for young people to showcase their skills, even if they have never performed before, it doesn't matter.\n\n\"If you have a love for music and\/or dance, at whatever level, the project is open to anyone aged 11-25.\"\n\nFor more information on the Aspire In Arts workshops contact: info@aspireinarts.org, 07885 276691,
