This country belongs to all Gambians and no outsider will come and develop the country for us. It's our responsibility, either at individual or collective level to develop it in accordance with section 220 of the 1997 Constitution and other laws of the country we proudly called motherland.\n\nThis new government came to power amidst slogans and promises for job creation, creating conducive environment for all in the name of democracy, rule of good governance and respect for human rights regardless of our status in life.\n\nSpecific references were made to youth employment among other methods meant to curb and reduce higher level of the ongoing illegal youth migration to Europe and other places perceived to have greener pasture for sustenance of their dear lives and that of their families back at home, where future seems hold nothing good for them.\n\nThis government is barely nine months old in the office and could hardly boast of records showing mass job creation for the people of the country, especially the youths, who are said to have played crucial role in the campaign for change of a government described as one of the most brutal, tyrannical and crude in the history of the Gambia and beyond, hence the advent of our perceived new found democratic dispensation under Adama Barrow.\n\nUnfortunate Record\n\nThe GRA Observer Company case is very unfortunate, sad and uncalled as far as hopes and aspirations of Gambians and none in the new leadership is concerned. Instead of fulfilling core responsibilities and fundamental obligations of democratic governments across the globe that derived and continue get their source of power and will from the people of the country, as per outlined in the preamble of the cited 1997 constitution, the GRA unfortunately for reasons best known to its management interrupted these fundamental obligations of the government in the name of tax arrears that spread over 15 years under dictator Jammeh.\n\nEvery democratic government has the core responsibility of the following to its people; to protect, promote and fulfill the fundamental rights and freedoms, failure of which means failed government and the need to re-exercise our fundamental constitution right to political participation as contained in section 26 of the cited constitution and get rid of such a miserable failed government, as its was done on 1st December 2016 to the dictatorship regime of Jammeh.\n\nThe entangle Observer debt of over 17 million dalasis, does come within the nine months of the new government, instead its an accumulation that commenced with few hundreds to thousands and into millions under the Jammeh regime, which begs the question as to where was the GRA and why they did not implement the laws they are now bragging about for effective and efficient implementation of tax laws?.\n\nOr is it another case of political gymnastic or better still call it political impressionist busy pleasing the political leadership at cost just to maintain their seat in the office at the expense of national growth and sustainable development or we are still having more state liabilities occupying our public offices good for nothing than opportunistic desires above the interest and welfare of the state?.\n\nThe Observer Company has similar rights and obligations as that of the GRA, since they are all creation of the law, they have what lawyers called artificial legal statute. That is they could be sue in court and they could also sue anyone being natural or artificial persons, hence the concept of succession or succeeding management of such institutions. The Observer debt was occasioned under various managements to date and the GRA also had various management to date and nothing was done about the steady growing tax arrears in issue.\n\nYes nothing was done about and no attempts made to have it address, because of the fear of the consequences of any such attempt under Jammeh. GRA officials were busy protecting their seats in the office and could now shamelessly start bragging about the matter well after the departure of Jammeh, which clearly shows lack of sincerity, honesty, professionalism and double standard game.\n\nWhereas Observer is guilty of tax arrears, GRA shall also be guilty of inefficiency, lack of competence, abuse of office and betrayal of public trust and confidence, as they are in office to implement our tax laws without favour, affection or ill will in line with the oath of allegiance they took before assuming that office.\n\nThere is no provision for selective tax collection in our tax laws, including the GRA Act and The VAT Act that Was said to have been used in the first closure few days before the Muslim feast of Koriteh. As conscious citizens, we cannot afford to have selective tax collection in the country by any authority including the GRA, since it has no basis and would led to arbitrary use of power. Selective tax collection and unjustifiable exhibition of self impose anger against innocence hard working honest citizens could have far reaching potential implications for those guilty under true democratic governments, trading in the name of rule of law, good governance and respect for human rights of its citizens.\n\nGovernment will not sell Observer now\n\nThis was contained in an article published in this medium, relating to one Prince Sankanu's interest to buy the Observer Company, Publishers of the Daily Observer Newspaper. He is said to have written to the Ministry of Justice to that effect, hence the replied indicating government's position not to sale the company now on grounds of its belonging to frozen companies of dictator Jammeh.\n\nWhere is Jammeh's name on Observer documents?\n\nThe above statement inspired this question as to where the government or to be precise the Justice ministry found the name of Yahya Jammeh on any of the Observer Company documents?. And if they do have it in their possession, please let them show it to the public through publication in any of the editions of the local newspapers Please, since the Attorney General Chambers and Ministry of Justice is responsible for advising government on legal issues, purely base on law, facts and reasons.\n\nThere is document that bears Jammeh's name on any of the Observer registered documents. The only step the government could have done was to forfeit the company to the sate, since it was raddled with ownership crisis after the departure of Jammeh, whose greed for power spared no public or private entities, including the Observer Company. It takes them as he pleases, but outside of the law.\n\nNothing stop this government to take over operations of Observer Company by putting in place effective management without closing it down, which has far more implications than expected.\n\nEconomic lost\n\nIt's one of the most leading, read and biggest newspapers in the country. It enjoys over millions of readers across the globe on both print and online. It has over 100 staff on the paid slip, which is quite different from huge number of Freelance Journalists in various capacities paid on weekly basis according to their published stories or articles.\n\nThe printing sector further employed more freelance compliers working in the night shift to have the paper properly compiled for the market in the morning, through huge number of vendors that stormed the office early morning on every publication dates.\n\nAlmost every foreign mission in the Gambia is a subscriber to two or more copies of the Daily Observer newspaper and almost all of them through their drivers or messengers use various means of transportation to collect their daily copies from the office. This clearly explains the number of fuel bought by this category of consumers on daily basis and the lost is not limited to only Observer Company, but the fuel stations, who also paid tax to the government.\n\nSubscription stretches to almost all government departments and institutions on daily basis with different number of copies depending on their request and these ferried to them various means, including the use of official vehicles, vendors or hired messengers to that effect, all of whom n one way or the other use transport or paid fares and the end result of government having tax from such activities.\n\nIndividual citizens, especially senior and retired citizens subscribed to the Observer copies on daily basis, depending on their capacities and desired and they hardly missed a single publication of this medium of communication.\n\nThe news vendors also depends on the number of sales made on a daily basis to take care of their needs devoid of crimes and violence thus, the concept of earning a decent living and reduce temptations for youth migration through the back to Europe.\n\nThe lost is not is justifiable by any sound economist. The amount of fuel both in-terms cash power and generator on daily basis used at the Observer Company on daily basis, is enough contribution towards achieving sustainable development of a country that leadership is said to have inherited zero economy and their promise to create more jobs, as opposed to closure of such job opportunities, especially for over hundreds of people, both Gambian and none alike.\n\nHow Long Will Observer Remain Locked?\n\nThis is another question that every compassionate Gambian and none would like to know. How long will Observer be locked up with potentials impacts of having its printing machines badly damaged beyond repaired, as rotten metals could hardly work as expected, especially machines that required daily operations.\n\nThe current closure is premised on court order at the instance of GRA, through the undefended legal suit filed in court, despite state decision to place the company under a receivership of Augustus Prom and the public statement by both the justice and information ministers that, the Observer will never be closed.\n\nThe above statement and the current closure left many doubt as to the true objectives of the government, as GRA is part and parcel of the same government, despite dancing behind claims of tax arrears.\n\nYes its tax arrears, but should that mean punishing the entire staff for the offence committed under the dictator. It's nothing more than punishment and very calculative for that matter as per the timing of the first and second closure respectively. The first was done few days before the Koriteh prayers, right in the Holy Months of Ramadan, which further begs the intention, compassion and religious faith of the GRA officials responsible, since Ramadan is considered to be a month of strengthening our faith, compassion and love for each other.\n\nThis development left many families without basic needs for the said Koriteh prayers as the month long fasting took its share of their pockets, coupled with preparations for the prayer.\n\nThe second closure was also made few days before the Tobaski prayers, also left the families in pains, as the first closure did not only affect business of the company, but also delayed salaries for three months, hence reason for dissatisfaction and disappointment over the steps taken under the new government, as far as the Observer Company and its well wishers are concerned.\n\nThought this might not be considered great disappointment under the eyes of the new government still basking in the glory of popular support at 1st December presidential elections, but such is the basis and gradual starting pointing for popular disappointments, disapproval and shock over governments across the globe for their indifferences to the interest and welfare of their subjects (citizens and humanity at large).\n\nSuch deliberate blind moves towards welfare of the people of the country are also the starting point for dictatorship, including that of our very own Yahya Jammeh.\n\nCitizens both minority and majority must be consider in all government policies and decisions. We cannot afford the cost of having a country run on the basis of revenge and the desire to punish others associated with the very dictators produced and brought up right in our face.\n\nAn ordinary Observer staff has no control over the said tax arrears accumulated over such a long period of time, since they cannot be punished as they are already punished by actions of the government, either in the name of GRA Vat act or Court order.\n\nBeside statistics and facts tenable within public domain on tax arrears shows the number of companies and institutions in the country that owe even far greater tax arrears to the state than Observer. Again the question remain as to where is the GRA and what action have they taken against those having over 100 million dalasis tax arrears, or it just confirmed selective tax collection system driving in our face without anyone having the right to question and reason over it?.\n\nRecords illustrated how Jammeh used Gambians when he came to power on July 22nd 1994 and dumped them at various levels. Almost all Gambians, especially intellectuals and none fall victims of his abuse of power and greed, hence the need for reason, rule of law, principles of good governance and respect for human rights to prevail over attempts to lease anger against one another.\n\nGRA lack of proper homework on Observer\n\nThere was total failure on the part of the GRA about true operations and financial status of the Observer Company. This newspaper company has been relocated from its rented house in Bakau way back in 2008 to its present location occupying former Quantumnet building under the directive of dictator Jammeh.\n\nHowever, unconfirmed reports have it that, the dictator purchased the said building from the Quantumnet management through one of the director of Observer Company at the time, though the Quantumnet could be honest enough to verified this claimed as they are still alive.\n\nAs stated earlier, there is no document that bears the name f Jammeh on observer, thought he could own he building or the compound, but not the newspaper company itself in line with the law on either registration or transfer of titles to companies.\n\nTherefore, even if GRA succeed in closing the Observer Company, they cannot take control of the building and the compound therein, as different ownership existed to that effect.\n\nThe only building constructed on that land is the printing press built by Pa malick Faye led management, which when sold together with entire equipment of the newspaper company cannot settle the 17 million debt in issue.\n\nIts probable that the quantumnet building described by many as glass house, looks very attractive to the GRA management and build up expectations known to them for the unpopular decision, seen and viewed by many as very irrational in our found democracy that supposed to be exemplary for the rest of the globe, especially emerging democracies in Africa and beyond.\n\nJohn Locke trust theory\n\nThis drew my attention to what John Locke, one of the leading natural law theories said about the concept of government as a trust, that men put their trust in the sovereign (Government). He said a ruler who betrayed this trust may be over thrown, as such a ruler put himself or herself into a state of war with his or her subjects and each of these subjects has the same rights to resist him or her as any other unjust aggressor.\n\nHe further outlined the concept of raising against tyranny in the following exposition; That when the oppressed people resist tyranny, it is not they who disturb government or bring back the state of war. Rebellion is an opposition, not to persons, but authority. He said tyrants has no authority, its tyrants who are the true rebels.\n\nThese principles were clearly conducted in the Gambia, both before and events leading to 1st December 2016 Presidential elections, as people were determined to see Jammeh out because of the above features he leased and continue leased on us. We only pray such is not repeated in the country, as we move towards achieving .our development objectives. Lets justice always guide our actions and good prevail over evil at all times.\n\nViews: 16\n\nI like this article\n\nI did not like this","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
