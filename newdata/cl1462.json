non-religious organisation the Humanist Society says the government must reconsider how it allows churches to influence policies such as education\n\nLESS than a quarter of Scots now say they are religious, a study claims.\n\nThe findings raise concerns about official stats on devotion to faiths according to the poll's organisers.\n\nHigher numbers in other surveys are down to how questions are worded claim the Humanist Society.\n\nAnd the non-religious organisation says the government must reconsider how it allows churches to influence policies such as education.\n\nChief executive Gordon MacRae, said: \"There could be as much as a 15 per cent difference between 'official statistics' and the reality of religion's place in the Scottish public daily lives.\n\n\"This raises major questions about key policy decisions made by government regarding special rights given to religious bodies under law.\n\nFor example, the right of Scotland's churches to hold the balance of power on local education committees.\"\n\nAccording to the poll of 1,016 adults -- which asked \"are you religious?\" -- just 23.6 per cent said they were, while 72.4 per cent said they were not.\n\nIn the latest Social Attitudes Survey in 2016, when people were asked whether \"you regard yourself as belonging to any particular religion\", 41 per cent said they did and 58 per cent said they did not.\n\nBut the Church of Scotland's Rev Norman Smith said: \"As a Church we are not driven by numbers.\n\n\"We are well aware formal membership has declined, yet the role of spirituality in people's lives remains important.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Catholic Church said: \"The question \"are you religious?\" does not lend itself to a 'Yes\/No' answer.\n\n\"That 72 per cent of Scots describe themselves as not 'religious' shouldn't be read as imp-lying, they have 'no religion'.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
