The military denies any policy of encouraging radical groups.\nBoth Islamist groups deny their political ambitions were engineered by the military. The official army spokesman was not available for comment after queries were sent to the press wing.\nStill, hundreds of MML supporters, waving posters of Saeed and demanding his release from house arrest, chanted \"Long live Hafiz Saeed! Long live the Pakistan army!\" at political rallies during the past week.\n\"Anyone who is India's friend is a traitor, a traitor,\" went another campaign slogan, a reference to Sharif's attempts to improve relations with long-time foe India that was a source of tension with the military.\n\n'DERADICALISATION' PLAN\nBoth Saeed and Khalil are proponents of a strict interpretation of Islam and have a history of supporting violence - each man was reportedly a signatory to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's 1998 fatwa declaring war on the United States.\nThey have since established religious groups that they say are unconnected to violence, though the United States maintains those groups are fronts for funnelling money and fighters to militants targeting India.\nAnalyst Khaled Ahmed, who has researched Saeed's Jamaat-ud-Dawa charity and its connections to the military, says the new political party is clearly an attempt by the generals to pursue an alternative to dismantling its militant proxies.\n\"One thing is the army wants these guys to survive,\" Ahmed said. \"The other thing is that they want to also balance the politicians who are more and more inclined to normalize relations with India.\" \nThe military's Inter-Services Intelligence agency first began pushing the political mainstreaming plan in April 2016, according to retired general Shuaib, a former director of the army's military intelligence wing that is separate from the ISI.\nHe said the proposal was shared with him in writing by the then-ISI chief, adding that he himself had spoken with Khalil as well as Saeed in an unofficial capacity about the plan.\n\"Fazlur Rehman Khalil was very positive. Hafiz Saeed was very positive,\" Shuaib said. \"My conversation with them was just to confirm those things which I had been told by the ISI and other people.\"\nSaeed has been under house arrest since January at his house in the eastern city of Lahore. The United States has offered a $10 million reward for information leading to his conviction over the Mumbai attacks.\nThen-Prime Minister Sharif, however, was strongly against the military's mainstreaming plan, according to Shuaib and three members of Sharif's inner circle, including one who was in some of the tense meetings over the issue.\nSharif wanted to completely dismantle groups like JuD. Disagreement on what to do about anti-India proxy fighters was a major source of rancour with the military, according to one of the close Sharif confidants. \nIn recent weeks several senior figures from the ruling PML-N party have publicly implied that elements of the military - which has run Pakistan for almost half its modern history and previously ousted Sharif in a 1999 coup - had a hand in the court ouster of Sharif, a charge both the army and the court reject.\nA representative of the PML-N, which last month replaced him as prime minister with close ally Shahid Khaqi Abbasi, said the party was \"not aware\" of any mainstreaming plan being brought to the table.\n\nRELIGION AND POLITICS\nSome analysts worry that mainstreaming such controversial groups would be a risky strategy for Pakistan. \nU.S. President Donald Trump's administration has threatened sanctions against members of Pakistan's military and even raised the specter of declaring Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\"It will send a wrong message,\" said analyst Zahid Hussain, who nevertheless thought that Saeed's new party would have a \"negligible\" effect on Pakistani elections because religious parties have never won more than a few seats in parliament.\nOthers are not so sure.\nSheikh, the MML candidate in Sunday's by-election who says he was handpicked by Hafiz Saeed, vowed to establish strict Islamic rule and \"break\" liberalism and secularism.\nAnalyst Ahmed warned that few existing religious parties  have a charismatic leader like Saeed, and Pakistan may find itself unable to control a rising tide of Islamist sentiment. \n\"If Hafiz Saeed comes into the mainstream, it's not that he is going to be politicized,\" he added. \"It's that he is going to make politics more religious.\"\n\n (Additional reporting by Mubasher Bukhari in LAHORE, Syed Raza Hassan in KARACHI; Writing by Kay Johnson; Editing by Alex Richardson)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
