(Well, maybe it's a mini-bar -- open access to product, in fancy places, with a presumed audience that's affluent and design-minded.) Vending machines are a unique form of commerce, mostly defined by the lack of human interaction at the point of transaction. This kind of unmanned retail operation has a long history (the vending history timeline on the website of NAMA, the National Automatic Merchandising Association, kicks off with Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty; it is delightful), with efficiency as its primary appeal. A tiny, self-contained store without an employee saves all sorts of overhead: Less required real estate, lower payroll, shockingly greater likelihood that shoplifters will be crushed to death.\n\nThese efficiencies aren't gravy, though; they're essential. They work by way of a simple economy of scale: If you run a few dozen machines (or a few thousand), it becomes possible to buy your products at a discount, to warehouse the products more effectively, and to both fill and repair your vending units in a more streamlined way. These businesses live or die by logistics. [...]\n\nSo many products, across so many Bodegas, in so many unique configurations poses a set of phenomenally complex logistical conundra: How are the products purchased? Where are they warehoused? How are they bundled for distribution to their unique Bodegas? Who restocks the Bodegas? How are the restocks transported? How can the company ensure that there's sufficient route density -- that there are enough Bodegas in each local area, which need to be restocked frequently enough, on harmonious schedules, to cover the costs of labor and transportation? [...]\n\nWhen I joined in on Bodega's public Twitter flogging (with tweets including several that turned into this article), I got a reply from Nadim Hossain, a startup executive who's done time at several major Silicon Valley success stories. He wrote, \"Appreciate your insights! Curious why Bodega is eliciting such strong negative reactions? If it works, you've proven it's an audacious idea.\"\n\nInside of that lives a peculiarly Silicon Valley syllogism: Success is heightened by outside skepticism, therefore outside skepticism may be an indicator of success -- Hossain later tweeted that he thinks the Bodega idea \"has merit.\" But I'm more stuck on that word, \"audacious.\" I think Hossain means it to be about boldness and daring, which are qualities that remain to be seen -- if the startup fails, it won't have been bold and daring, it will have been foolhardy. But I think by another meaning, Bodega is already audacious: It is rash and thoughtless. It's ethically and culturally bankrupt, but it also seems to be poorly constructed and unsustainably scaled. So it'll be the other kind of bankrupt, too.\n\nAnne Branigin,\n\nDon't worry, guys! Surveys were conducted! The Latins were cool with it!\n\nExcept, of course, for the ones who aren't. Not counted in that \"97%\" was the chairman of the New York State Coalition of Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Frank Garcia. He represents thousands of bodega owners in New York, and he did not mince words in the Fast Company article.\n\nAccording to Garcia, many bodega owners are suffering because of escalating rents and competition from delivery services like Fresh Direct. A service like this could further adversely affect them. \"Bodegas can't compete with this technology, because it is so much more expensive to have a brick-and-mortar store than a small machine,\" Garcia says. \"To compete with bodegas and also use the 'bodega' name is unbelievably disrespectful.\"  [...]\n\nBut in 2017, ventures like \"Bodega\" are, in fact, peak America: repackaging the work of communities of color for cheaper and faster, with no shame left over to even bother calling their theft by a different name.\"\n\nMelanie Ehrenkranz,\n\nTwo former Google employees see your beloved local bodega and raise you a glorified vending machine. In typical Silicon Valley fashion, tech bros are capitalizing on the charm of your community mom-and-pop convenience store, aiming to put them out of business while co-opting their name. [...]\n\nSolving a problem that doesn't exist to threaten the livelihoods of local bodegas is nefarious enough, but the venture also stands to get rid of arguably one of the most important bodega features -- the bodega cat -- which they've also co-opted for the startup's logo. How dare you.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
