So the boss of a club demands a lot more than this intellectual pornography.\n\nJust as I thought. Sullivan has been caught lying to us again, and he has been shown up by Sporting's Director. -- West Ham Fan Zone (@WHUFCFZ)\n\nSeptember 2, 2017\n\n\"Mr David Sullivan has a duty to prove what he says. That is why Sporting clube de Portugal challenges him to publicly show the proposals he claims to have been made as well as the evidence that Sporting CP received them.\n\n\"One thing is certain: Sporting CP, has already been said, does not cut legs to its athletes. But we have nothing to do with the performance of entrepreneurs or relatives who live at the expense of players and who are offering them a club at a club price, without a mandate, as if they were cheap supermarket merchandise.\n\n\"Athlete and the club, and creating regrettable situations that have already forced the sporting club of Portugal to take drastic measures to defend these characters who parasitize the lives of some players.\"\n\nCarvalho was a long-standing target for West Ham after an impressive season for Sporting CP which saw the 25-year-old make 32 league appearances for the club - netting two goals and providing three assists - and this story could still have some legs despite the transfer window coming to an end.\n\n  ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
