More than 100 other Minnesota cities tax lodging.\n\nCity Administrator Clinton Gridley said a CVB could help Woodbury keep pace with other communities.\n\n\"To the extent that we don't market as other communities do with CVBs, I think there's a competitive disadvantage that can occur,\" he said at a city council work session in mid-August. \"Over time, as communities are broadcasting themselves, their opportunities, we might find ourselves less competitive and desirable.\"\n\nThe initiative would mainly focus on marketing Woodbury as an athletics destination by encouraging sports clubs to host tournaments at the HealthEast Sports Center.\n\nIt would also promote features like the city's parks, golf courses and retail stores.\n\nBut the proposal received a lukewarm greeting from council members during the workshop.\n\n\"We've made it this far, this successfully,\" said council member Julie Ohs. \"Do we need this, or is this just nice to have?\"\n\nCouncil member Andrea Date said she struggled with the idea of marketing Woodbury's sports and health care opportunities to draw in visitors.\n\n\"Is that really what I want it to look like? Is that how I want the city to be marketed or is that just what we have?\" she said. \"It's not super inspiring to me. ...
