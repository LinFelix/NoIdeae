The retirement savings gap between white and other minority groups extends beyond pensions, 401(k)s or other retirement accounts.\n\nThe survey shows older white Americans are also more likely to collect Social Security benefits, inherit money from their families or receive income from the sale of a home or other physical assets.\n\nThe disparity in retirement readiness is a sign that the structural inequalities black and Latino workers face during their working years extend into retirement. For example, the unemployment rate among African-Americans is twice that of whites. On top of that, blacks earn less than whites with similar education and experience, research shows.\n\n\"Having good saving habits is good but black and Latino workers are just always worse off and it makes every aspect of saving for retirement harder,\" said Matthew Rutledge, an economist at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.\n\nAbout 38 per cent of older white Americans said they had sufficient money for retirement compared with 20 per cent for African-Americans.\n\nFour in 10 older Americans say they think they'll outlive their retirement savings.\n\n\"Black and Latino families benefit from being close,\" Rutledge said, adding that family members help to care for children and the elderly. \"But it doesn't pay off when compared to whites family's (financial) contributions.\"\n\nFamilies not only pass down money, but also information on how to handle finances.\n\n\"They have learned better savings behaviour from the previous generation,\" he said. \"Older Americans who received financial help from family are less likely to have racked up credit card debt or student loans. They can save (for retirement) rather than paying off debt.\"\n\nThe poll showed whites are significantly more likely, compared to African-Americans and Latinos to say they have a retirement account. They're also more likely than African-Americans to say they will have income from the sale of physical assets.\n\nBut even when it comes to the most basic form of income during retirement, whites are more likely to say they will receive Social Security payments â\" 82 per cent compared to 62 per cent for African-Americans and 60 per cent for Latinos, the survey found.\n\nThe situation is so dire that some older African-Americans and Latinos have no sources of income for retirement â\"14 per cent compared to 4 per cent of whites, the survey found.\n\nMaria Villanueva, 69, is one of them. Villanueva doesn't collect Social Security payments because she didn't pay into the system. Villanueva immigrated illegally to California in the 70s to work as a farmworker and became a legal resident after the Immigration Reform and Control Act was signed into law. The single mother worked as a domestic worker but was paid in cash.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
