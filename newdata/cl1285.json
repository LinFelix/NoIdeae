While firms such as Google, Facebook and Amazon boast billions of dollars in turnover, many of their European offices report little to no profit or sometimes even a loss.\n\n'Question of fairness'\n\nIn the digital age \"the current taxation system no longer applies and that is why we have to find another solution,\" said Estonia's finance minister, Toomas Toniste.\n\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the proposal was \"a question of fairness,\" adding that the \"giants of the digital world\" cannot be allowed to generate with revenue with European user data \"without paying tax on it.\"\n\nLe Maire indicated that about 10 of the EU's 28 member states back the idea, including Germany, Spain and Italy.\n\nHowever, that would not be enough to the see the new tax proposals become law. Europe-wide tax reform requires the unanimity of all 28 states, which in the past has proven nearly impossible on tax issues.\n\nRead more: German media groups to form data alliance\n\nCountries including Denmark, Luxembourg, Malta and Sweden expressed reluctance towards an emergency bill. Those countries would rather see Silicon Valley's mega profits and low tax bills addressed on the international level, such as through the G20 or OECD, a group of rich nations.\n\n\"I think we should be very careful not to tax on what we are going to live on in the future,\" Danish Finance Minister Kristian Jensen said. \"I am... always skeptical by new taxes and I think Europe taxes heavily enough,\" he added.\n\nWhile Sweden and Luxembourg's ministers said they weren't against the proposal in principle, they warned that introducing such a plan solely on a European level would likely drive online firms to set up shop in Asia.\n\nThe agreement is not expected at the summit, although it should serve as preparation ahead of the Tallinn Digital Summit, which will bring together EU heads of state and government on September 29.\n\nThe move reflects both the increasingly vocal public anger in Europe aimed at low tax-paying online behemoths and the European authorities push for more control over how the digital world operates.\n\nIn June, European antitrust officials fined search giant Google a record 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion) for unfairly favoring its own services in search results.\n\nThe EU's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, has also demanded that Apple pay back some 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland.\n\nEurope, and Vestager in particular, has looked to combat the near-monopolistic dominance of many Silicon Valley giants. Announcing Google's antitrust fine, she said: \"We congratulate you for being successful. But the applause stops when you stop competing on the merits. You will never get a free pass to stop competing on the merits, neither in the market you dominate nor in other markets.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
