But an educated workforce is a prerequisite for continued growth.\n\nAmazon's decision to identify a metropolitan area beyond Seattle for a second headquarters is big news for cities striving to foster economic development. One of the most important elements in evaluating potential locations is the availability of technical and managerial talent. When businesses look to expand, they often compare potential sites in terms of the percentage of adults with a bachelor's degree, the total population base with a bachelor's degree and the number of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) graduates.\n\nAmazon's expansion highlights a critical need in our region: an educated workforce. Utah ranks highest in the nation in percentage of adults who started but did not complete college, currently about 30 percent. Significant financial benefits of college come with completion of the degree: Individuals with a bachelor's degree are less likely to be unemployed, less likely to live in poverty and less likely to use government resources and have higher earnings throughout life than peers who did not complete their degrees. Even in the early phases of recovery from the recent recession, new college graduates earned significantly more than peers without a degree.\n\nUniversities have emphasized the importance of college access for the past several decades. We assert that we must now sharpen our focus on college completion. We do little to help individuals or our communities when we attract students to college in absence of a clear plan to finish their degrees.\n\nThis has been a top priority for the University of Utah, and we have steadily increased completion rates over the past five years. Seventy-six percent of students now complete their degrees within eight years, and 67 percent do so within six years. We must continue to improve these metrics because they benefit every graduate and they ensure the economic vitality of our state.\n\nAs the U. continues to promote degree completion, innovative partnerships can accelerate progress. Internships in a wide range of industry contexts allow students to connect classroom learning with business needs while illustrating the ever-growing importance of a college degree. New models of financing college, such as income share models, are being developed across the nation, allowing individuals to directly invest in student success. The U. will continue to secure support for such innovative approaches with partners who share the aim of accelerating degree completion.\n\nEconomic development in Utah relies on availability of an educated workforce. In parallel, individual and family well-being are linked to degree completion. We ask for the partnership of all who can join in our efforts to ensure that more students cross the finish line to the degree, whether that partnership comes in the form of welcoming student interns, supporting scholarships, finding unique approaches to college financing or other strategies that enable degree completion. This is a cause worthy of our collective effort: Businesses from around the world are taking notice.\n\nRuth V. Watkins is the senior vice president for academic affairs at the University of Utah.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
