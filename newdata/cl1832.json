You have begun a journey to understand the history of the surroundings of the beginnings of our nation,\" Morgan-Welch said. \"In Colchester, at that period, black children experienced the most rare of opportunities: an education.\"\n\nThe Historic School for Colored Children, situated next to the Colchester Hayward Fire Museum on South Main Street, is a replica of the original structure, which served as a district schoolhouse before the construction of the old Bacon Academy in 1803. Once the new school was erected, the old structure became the School for Colored Children, and is thought to have enrolled between 30 and 40 students before it closed its doors in 1840, according to the Colchester Historical Society.\n\nThe replica's construction was funded by the Liverant family - Arthur, a local historian and antiques dealer, and his sisters Abby Liverant Gerrity and Linda Liverant Barger - and formally turned over to the town as a gift.\n\n\"We were welcomed in Colchester, and we want to be welcoming to everyone else,\" Arthur Liverant said after First Selectman Art Shilosky cut the ribbon at the schoolhouse entrance. \"This schoolhouse is a symbol of diversity and what it means to us as a town.\"\n\nShilosky and others at the ceremony said although they've lived in town for years, they never knew Colchester was home to a very unique piece of history.\n\n\"It's unbelievable,\" Shilosky said. \"I've lived in this town for 40 years, and I never had a clue about this history until I met Mr. Liverant. I had no concept.\"\n\nTown resident Janice Adams, who says four generations of her family attended Colchester schools, said she had never heard about the School for Colored Children until recently.\n\n\"I learned a whole lot of stuff I never knew, even though I grew up here and graduated from Bacon Academy,\" she said.\n\nAfter the ribbon-cutting, attendees toured the one-room structure, which has been furnished with period desks, slates, a chalkboard and black stove. The dedication will be followed by a series of \"community conversations\" in efforts to further understand the history of the School for Colored Children and to help shape an exhibit on the school slated to open at the Colchester History Museum next year.\n\n\"There is much more to learn,\" Morgan-Welch said. \"We're just scratching the surface of these hidden figures. We - us - together, have made a way out of no way. Colchester's history is such an amazing lesson. All of you gathered here represent the heart of America, and that gives me great pride and hope for the future.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
