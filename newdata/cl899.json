Johannesson, who was meeting leaders of other parties, was expected to make an announcement later Saturday.\n\nBenediktsson on Friday called for a new parliamentary election after a junior coalition party decided to quit due to a \"breach of trust\" within the center-right government.\n\nEarly Friday, leaders of Bright Future, one of the three partner parties in the government, said they had ended their coalition with the Independence Party and the prime minister.\n\nThe Reform Party, another junior partner, has called for new elections as soon as possible.\n\nIt was revealed on Thursday that Benediktsson's father signed a letter of recommendation so that a convicted pedophile would receive what in Iceland is called \"restored honor,\" which effectively wipes the criminal record of a person who has served his or her sentence.\n\nLetters of recommendation are required for this procedure.\n\nMinister of Justice Sigridur Andersen, also from the Independence Party, said Thursday night that she had informed Benediktsson of his father's letter in July, Icelandic public broadcaster RUV reported.\n\nBut Benediktsson neglected to inform Bright Future and Reform Party leaders of the letter until Monday, according to RUV.\n\nAfter the October 2016 election, the Independence Party took a strong lead by securing 21 out of the 63 seats in parliament after winning 29 percent of the ballots cast. Together, the three-party coalition holds a slim majority with 32 seats.\n\nThe center-right coalition government took office in January after lengthy negotiations.\n\nChina-US Ping-Pang diplomacy
