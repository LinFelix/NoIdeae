Thanks to automation and artificial intelligence, repetitive jobs are set to redundate more jobs predict industry heads.Speaking to Express, Dr Dinesh Chandrasekar, director of Global Solutions & Innovations, Hitachi Consulting and a researcher said mass layoffs cannot take place in India as it would give rise to smart criminals. \"I'm sure the government will not allow mass layoffs and instead would ask the corporates to go with phased layoffs.\n\nThere is every possibility that techies with lots of knowledge can transform into smart criminals involving in cyber thefts and the like,\" he said. According to him, identification of problem and creation of solutions should become the focus of the many students or employees in India instead of settling for mundane jobs.\n\nSrikant Srinivas, regional director of NASSCOM in an interview with Express said, \"Automation has hit the IT industry and it is all encompassing. Jobs that require less skills will get automated, while higher skilled jobs will be created and unless one delivers, survival can not be assured.\" One should always remember that skill sets scores over qualification and both organisations and individuals should shoulder the responsibility to be skilled and should work towards it, he added.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
