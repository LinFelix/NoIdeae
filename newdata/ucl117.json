Security Council condemned the \"highly provocative\" missile launch by North Korea.\nThe council's 15 members had already stepped up sanctions against North Korea in response to a nuclear bomb test it staged on Sept. 3, imposing a ban on North Korea's textile exports and capping its imports of crude oil.\nWhite House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said the United States was fast running out of patience for diplomatic solutions on North Korea's missile and nuclear programs.\n\"We've been kicking the can down the road, and we're out of road,\" McMaster told reporters, referring to Pyongyang's repeated missile tests in defiance of international pressure.\n\"For those ... who have been commenting on a lack of a military option, there is a military option,\" he said, adding that it would not be the Trump administration's preferred choice.\nThe U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, echoed McMaster's strong rhetoric, even as Washington continued to emphasize that its preferred resolution to the crisis is through diplomacy and sanctions.\n\"What we are seeing is, they are continuing to be provocative, they are continuing to be reckless and at that point there's not a whole lot the Security Council is going to be able to do from here, when you've cut 90 percent of the trade and 30 percent of the oil,\" Haley said.\nNorth Korea has launched dozens of missiles under leader Kim Jong Un as it accelerates a weapons program designed to give it the ability to target the United States with a powerful, nuclear-tipped missile.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said that he is \"more confident than ever that our options in addressing this threat are both effective and overwhelming.\" He said at Joint Base Andrews near Washington that North Korea \"has once again shown its utter contempt for its neighbors and for the entire world community.\"\n\nLATEST MISSILE\nNorth Korea's latest test missile flew over Hokkaido in northern Japan on Friday and landed in the Pacific about 2,000 km (1,240 miles) to the east, the Japanese government said.\nIt traveled about 3,700 km (2,300 miles) in total, according to South Korea's military, far enough to reach the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, which the North has threatened before.\n\"The range of this test was significant since North Korea demonstrated that it could reach Guam with this missile,\" the Union of Concerned Scientists advocacy group said in a statement. However, the accuracy of the missile, still at an early stage of development, was low, it said.     \nOn Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson called on China, Pyongyang's only ally, and Russia to apply more pressure on North Korea by \"taking direct actions of their own.\" \nBut Beijing pushed back.\nForeign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying denied that China held the key to easing tension on the Korean peninsula and said that duty lay with the parties directly involved. She also reiterated China's position that sanctions on North Korea are only effective if paired with talks.\nNorth Korea staged its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test earlier this month and in July tested long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching at least parts of the U.S. mainland. \nLast month, North Korea fired an intermediate range missile that also flew over Hokkaido into the ocean.     \nWarning announcements about the latest missile blared around 7 a.m. (2200 GMT Thursday) in parts of northern Japan, while many residents received alerts on their mobile phones or saw warnings on TV telling them to seek refuge.\nThe U.S. military said it had detected a single intermediate range ballistic missile but it did not pose a threat to North America or Guam.\nOn global markets, shares and other risk assets barely moved and gold fell as traders paid little attention to the latest missile test, shifting their focus to where and when interest rates will go up. \n\nDIFFERENCES OVER DIRECT TALKS\nTrump has promised not to allow North Korea to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile. \nRussia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said the United States needed to begin talks with North Korea, something that Washington has so far ruled out.\n“We called on our U.S. partners and others to implement political and diplomatic solutions that are provided for in the resolution,”  Nebenzia told reporters after the Security Council meeting. “Without implementing this, we also will consider it as a non-compliance with the resolution.” \nAsked about the prospect for direct talks, a White House spokesman said, \"As the president and his national security team have repeatedly said, now is not the time to talk to North Korea.”\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in also said dialogue with the North was impossible at this point. He ordered officials to analyze and prepare for possible new North Korean threats, including electromagnetic pulse and biochemical attacks.\nThe United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty. The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies.   \n\n(For graphic on North Korea's
