Hillary Clinton was coming to London the next week to promote her new book, Hard Choices. Would I like to do a public event with her? Interviewing her on stage? Yes, I would. Of course I would.\n\nI realised that this meant I would have to spend much of the weekend reading about Clinton's life as US secretary of state. Hard Choices was more than 900 pages long. But I got going and by Monday morning I had read two thirds of it. Then I got another call. Clinton wouldn't be able to do the event after all. I was disappointed, of course. Then I realised that there was a compensation. I wouldn't have to finish Hard Choices.\n\nClinton's previous book was one of the most boring, pointless volumes I have read in my life. I promise you that I deliver this judgment after thinking carefully about other boring books I have read. It was spectacularly unrevealing, almost unfathomably dull. How could someone (probably not even her, for heaven's sake, which made it worse) have turned her fascinating life into something so tedious? When I thought of why she wrote it, I was reminded of Michael Caine's answer when asked why he appeared in films he knew to be bad: \"I needed a new kitchen.\"\n\nAll of which explains why I did not embark on reading Clinton's new book, her campaign memoir What Happened, with great enthusiasm or high expectations. I thought it was highly unlikely to tell me what happened last year. And (oh no) it was almost 500 pages long.\n\nThis turned out to be unnecessarily pessimistic. What Happened is highly entertaining. It is spirited, well written and informative. It isn't flawless. It's obvious that there is a lot of Clinton herself in the book, but she had help from her speechwriters and from time to time the book lurches into campaign speech mode.\n\nThere are, for instance, chunks of ordinary folks telling their stories that moved the candidate as she \"took in their quiet, fierce dignity\". We are all too often regaled with \"a letter from a medical student named Kristin in Dearborn, Michigan\". And it flags a little at the end, as she peps up fellow Democrats and encourages people to get organised to defeat President Trump. Maybe you have to be American. On the whole, though, What Happened is personal, direct and pretty honest.\n\nShe talks well of her feelings of devastation at her defeat last November and the days of depression that followed. She says that it is rare even now for a day to go by without her taxing herself about why she lost. And she is scathing about Donald Trump and his misogyny and racism. After the video appeared in which he boasts of sexual assault, she says: \"I was not going to shake that man's hand.\"\n\nA section on her daily routine is bouncy and engrossing (anything from her calculation that during the campaign she spent the equivalent of 25 full days having her hair and make-up done to the fact that the Clintons keep track of the books they read, and Bill has a rating system). The writing about feminism is passionate, necessary and persuasive.\n\nWhat, though, about her overall case, her explanation of \"what happened\"? That I think is passionate, necessary, but ultimately not completely persuasive.\n\nWhat Happened is not a cool take on Clinton's loss. It is raw and angry. There are a couple of \"sorrys\" in there, some general but vague (sorry I let you down), some specific but minor (sorry for calling Trump voters deplorable). But this is the case for the defence. In places this makes it important to read. Her description of the ludicrous nonsense about her emails -- she used a private email server for official communications while she was secretary of state -- shows how empty this so-called scandal was. Her argument that Russia interfered in the election, that such interference in American politics continues and that this is a serious national security concern cannot be responsibly ignored.\n\nThe evidence that there was Russian involvement in, for instance, hacking the email account of her campaign chairman, John Podesta, is pretty strong and supported by various official investigations. Her contention that this was highly disruptive is reasonable. Her suggestion that the Trump campaign may have collaborated with the Russians is much more speculative and the evidence so far quite thin. It's fortunate that she doesn't rely on it.\n\nThe book is less good on the puzzling question of her campaign schedule and why she didn't spend enough time in rust-belt states. However, she defends her campaign strategy adequately.\n\nYet I could not accept her broad thesis, at least not totally. Clinton flatly argues that she would not have lost without the email stuff and Russian interference. And she has a good bash at making this point stick. She mentions James Comey, the FBI director, 118 times in the book and blames his interventions, particularly his reopening of the investigation, for her defeat.\n\nThis argument is not absurd. The polling evidence did show her on track to win before Comey stepped in towards the end of the campaign. Yet it still misses the point.\n\nThe 2016 election was a change election. It would have been difficult for any Democrat to have won. The party had inhabited the White House for eight years and voters did not feel as though they were prospering. Racial attitudes had also worsened during this period and many white voters without university education, casting about for an explanation for the economic pressures they felt, chose to blame other ethnic groups and immigrants.\n\nWhat Happened doesn't ignore this. There's rather a good chapter on it, even if it is drowned out by the email and Russia stuff. Nor did Clinton ignore it during the campaign. However, she doesn't -- perhaps she couldn't -- draw the obvious conclusion from it. And the obvious conclusion is that she wasn't the right candidate to fight this election. She is fiercely intelligent, very experienced and reassuringly pragmatic, so in some ways it is a bit depressing to suggest that she wasn't the best bet for the Democrats.\n\nIt is also impossible to read any history of Clinton without concluding that her political career and her public image have suffered hugely from sexism. As she mentions in this memoir, her decision to work while married to Bill Clinton, and to carry on using her own name, were hugely controversial. She was eventually forced to change her surname from Rodham to Clinton by reaching the unavoidable conclusion that using her maiden name had contributed to his defeat when seeking re-election as governor of Arkansas in 1980.\n\nWhatever the origin of attitudes towards her, the attitudes were there. And to pick her as the nominee in a year when populist anger was on the rise was to court defeat.\n\nEarly in the book she describes her struggle to decide whether to run. She probably overdoes the indecision a little. Then she says of her preparations to take on populism: \"Bill and I closed out 2014 with a trip to the beautiful home of our friends Oscar and Annette de la Renta in the Dominican Republic. We swam, ate good food, played cards, and thought about the future. By the time we got back, I was ready to run.\"\n\nThe email pseudo-scandal was simply an expression of tiredness with her and with the Clintons. It didn't matter that there was nothing much there. It was a load of old rubbish that expressed a powerful sentiment, that articulated an idea. The Clintons, voters felt, would bring the circus back to town. They had been around too long and they weren't to be trusted.\n\nIt was this -- fair or unfair -- that defeated Hillary Clinton. Comey was just the vehicle for delivering it. And if he hadn't come along, something else probably would have.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
