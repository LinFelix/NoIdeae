Under the deal, Iran undertook to put limitations on its nuclear program in exchange for the termination of all nuclear-related sanctions against Tehran.\n\n\"Quite frankly, I think, it was a significant event, and positive event and history will show that was very positive just as the history has shown that Nixon at least talking to the Chinese was a lot better than the continuation of killing each other,\" Dr. Paul said.\n\n\"So I think this whole plan was well-motivated. And I think when people deserve credit they are ought to get it. But you know the control of a lot of information is done by neoconservatives, so they certainly wouldn't want to give Obama any credit for this agreement,\" he stated.\n\nDr. Paul's co-host, Daniel McAdams, added, \"Yeah, the neocons hate the deal but these are the same neocons who said, 'Hey, let's take down Saddam. It's going to be a cake walk, democracy is going to spring up all over. These are the guys who are always wrong.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to decide on October 15 whether Tehran has breached the 2015 nuclear agreement, and some fear he may abandon the nuclear accord.\n\n\"This whole idea that they [Iranians] are not following the rules is - again -- based on lies,\" Dr. Paul emphasized.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has on multiple occasions affirmed Iran's adherence to its commitments under the nuclear agreement.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
