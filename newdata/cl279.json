It was a lucky hole-in-one, I guess,\" Day told Golf Channel after carding a six-under-par 65 at Conway Farms in Lake Forest, where he won in 2015.\n\"It's been, I think, 10 years since last time I had a hole-in-one. I've had two eagles and a hole-in-one this week already, so everything's come in bunches.\"\nOne of those eagles was a chip-in from 30 feet from beyond the green at the par-five 14th. If the hole-in-one was lucky, the eagle was inch-perfect execution.\n\"It's very quick down there so I just wanted to get something just landing on the green,\" he said.\n\"(I'm) Very pleased with how the last two days went. I can't get too far ahead of myself. Last time I was here I was five shots better (after 36 holes). I've got to somehow try to catch up to my number. That's the main goal.\"\nFowler also finished with a rush, picking up five strokes in the final six holes for a 64 and joining Day at 13-under 129, while first round leader Marc Leishman was still on the course.\nThe top three players in the FedExCup standings, Americans Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas and Dustin Johnson, also had late tee times.\nThe BMW Championship is the third of four playoff events on the PGA Tour. The top points earner after next week's Tour Championship will receive a $10 million bonus awarded to the season-long FedExCup champion.
