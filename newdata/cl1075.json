See your name in print weekly or fortnightly, and get involved with TCS through talking about what interests you.\n\nTalking about anything from the best budget sex toys to dating someone on your course, and everything in between. Take a look at our kinky feminism column from last term for inspiration. We're especially interested in an LGBT+ perspective, and are happy to keep this column anonymous if you would prefer.\n\nCooking & food\n\nTake us through some of your favourite healthy (or really quite unhealthy) recipes. Your column could include anything from nutritional tips to how to make vegan\/ vegetarian junk, taking into account less-than-generous kitchen facilities.\n\nMoney & budgeting\n\nThis is something we may all struggle with, and can leave you with anxiety, insecurity and serious fomo. We're looking for any angle on the issue; from daily troubles to budgeting ideas - do you have any tips and tricks for making the most of limited funds? Are you a savvy shopper? What can be done to reduce financial stresses for students?\n\nThe Thursday Magazine\n\nLooking for views on the cultural aspects of Cambridge life - maybe you've seen some cool, hidden pieces of architecture on your walks to lectures; perhaps you've visited the Fitzwilliam and other museums and want a space to discuss their appeal; or you're a budding artist\/musician and want to talk about fitting it all in around studying. If you think you have a unique take on Film, TV, Music, Art or Literature send in your ideas.\n\nIf you've got a unique angle on something; want to comment on a rarely-discussed topic; or just want a space to let the world know your views, this is your chance! A column is a great way to gain regular journalistic writing experience.\n\nWe're more than happy to discuss and develop initial ideas before you apply - and if you're stuck for ideas but are keen to write, get in touch and have a think about one of our pitches.\n\n**The deadline for applications is Saturday 23rd September. Positions are also still available for News, Investigations, Theatre and Lifestyle Editors- more information can be found here.**","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
