She said she hopes Facebook's investment in research here will lead to more AI study.\n\nThis is the fourth AI lab opened by Facebook. The others are in Paris, New York and Menlo Park, California.\n\nPineau's focus on enabling computers to talk to humans in a natural way is of key interest to Facebook, which is competing with Apple, Google and others to develop virtual assistants.\n\nThe company also announced Can$7 million (US$6 million) in seed money for local AI research firms.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft already have so-called deep learning labs in Canada, which over the years has fostered a small but talented group of AI specialists.\n\nThe United States remains the global leader in AI, but much of its talent comes from abroad. Canada, with its less restrictive immigration policies, has become an attractive place to set up shop.\n\nOttawa has demonstrated a willingness to develop the field, earmarking Can$125 million (US$103 million) in its last budget for AI research.\n\n\"This new laboratory... will show that Canada is a leader in the economy of the future and an influential player in the field of artificial intelligence in the world,\" Trudeau said.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
