Most cases are filed against members of minority\ncommunities.\nNadeem James, 35, was arrested in July 2016, accused by a\nfriend of sharing material ridiculing the Prophet Mohammad on\nthe Whatsapp messaging service.\nLawyer Riaz Anjum said his client intended to appeal against\nthe verdict, passed on Thursday by a sessions court in the town\nof Gujrat.\nThere was widespread outrage across Pakistan last April when\nstudent Mashal Khan was beaten to death at his university in\nMardan following a dorm debate about religion.\nPolice arrested over 20 students and some faculty members in\nconnection with the killing.\nSince then, parliament has considered adding safeguards to\nthe blasphemy laws, a groundbreaking move given the emotive\nnature of the issue.\nThere have been at least 67 murders over unproven\nallegations of blasphemy since 1990, according to figures from a\nresearch centre and independent records kept by Reuters.\nAnd in 2011, a bodyguard assassinated Punjab provincial\ngovernor Salman Taseer after he called for the blasphemy laws to\nbe reformed.\nTaseer's killer, executed last year, has been hailed as a\nmartyr by religious hardliners.\n(Writing by Saad Sayeed; Editing by Kevin Liffey)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
