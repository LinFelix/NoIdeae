A couple of days ago, science teacher Pushpaleela bet a third class student for not doing homework.\n\nThe student reported the matter to his parents who lodged a complaint with the Education Department officials. District Education Officer (DEO) D. Devanand Reddy, Vijayawada Deputy DEO Ravi and Mandal Education Officer B.G. Margret visited the school and conducted an enquiry.\n\n\"We enquired about the punishment awarded to the student and recorded the statements of the victim, parents, staff, accused teacher and the students. During investigation, it was found that the teacher thrashed the student,\" said Mr. Reddy.\n\nThe institution is being run with NRI funds and the management is offering education free of cost. \"Barring this incident, there was no complaint against the school and the facilities are good,\" he told The Hindu.\n\nThe team also inspected the classrooms, verified the records on recognition, staff particulars and other facilities. The department had served a show cause notice on the school management. Ms. Pushpaleela was suspended immediately. However, no criminal case had been lodged, he said.\n\n\"We are waiting for the institute management's response to our notices. Based on the explanation, the department will submit a report to the government. We appeal to the teachers not to punish, beat, ill-treat and abuse children, which is a crime,\" the DEO said.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 19:45:25.338"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 19:45:25.049","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|kCmdoIfP938U18J8Pa8vh7\/O6hE=|cSsPJ9Xpkixz7ooIsP+Bcr\/3r+RYMzC3AyGFImxMjY2bR4SwCx\/n5g==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":1,"name":"Education"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/cat\/2":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.867,"name":"Law_Crime"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/86535ce7-f4cf-3df9-914e-6c00fb68cb9f","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Education","importance":"1","originalValue":"Education"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/77374d75-ca64-30d1-b274-e50d16002d05","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Euthenics","importance":"1","originalValue":"Euthenics"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/6036d9b9-578d-35b9-bf56-4bc267d2ff40","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Education reform","importance":"1","originalValue":"Education reform"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/35e91345-30a9-3695-b4b0-c3e37c2cbd09","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Home","importance":"2","originalValue":"Home"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/98eb3286-41b5-3ebd-8798-3891e92ab452","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Homework","importance":"2","originalValue":"Homework"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/fa110b35-2376-3668-b416-20cca4776af5","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Standards-based education","importance":"2","originalValue":"Standards-based education"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/SocialTag\/7":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/b473a8ab-75bc-3cdc-be8e-247366a04152\/SocialTag\/7","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/f0e03a16-99c2-39f5-a85b-a6249aaa2346","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"K.
