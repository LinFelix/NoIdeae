quotes)\nBEIRUT, Sept 15 (Reuters) - A top aide to President Bashar\nal-Assad said on Friday the Syrian government would fight any\nforce, including U.S.-backed forces also battling Islamic State\nmilitants, in its drive to recapture the whole of the country.\nAssad has previously vowed to recapture the whole of Syria.\nThe government controls the main urban centres in the west of\nthe country and has taken back much of the eastern desert from\nIslamic State in recent months.\n\"Whether it's the Syrian Democratic Forces, or Daesh\n(Islamic State) or any illegitimate foreign force in the country\n... we will fight and work against them so our land is freed\ncompletely from any aggressor,\" Bouthaina Shaaban said in an\ninterview with Hezbollah's Al Manar TV.\nShaaban said the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)\nhad captured areas from Islamic State \"without any fighting\",\napparently accusing them of collusion with the jihadists.\nThe SDF \"are trying to get areas (where there is) oil ...\nbut they will not get what they want,\" she said.\nShaaban also said plans to \"divide\" Syria had failed,\nwithout elaborating.\nThe Kurdish YPG militia, which dominates the SDF, has for\nyears controlled large parts of northeastern Syria.\nAdvances against Islamic State in its Raqqa stronghold and a\nnew offensive in Deir al-Zor are bringing more territory under\nthe control of the SDF.\n(Reporting by John Davison; Editing by Gareth Jones)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
