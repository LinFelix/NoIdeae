Forecasts for rising demand and the gradual restart of\nU.S. oil refineries after Hurricane Harvey pushed up prices.\nGold fell after a European Central Bank official called for\nscaling back the bank's stimulus program. Losses were capped\nwhen weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales renewed doubts the\nFederal Reserve will raise rates in December.\nYields on longer-dated U.S. Treasury maturities briefly\nadded to earlier declines after the weak data revived some\nconcerns about slower economic growth in the third quarter and\nthe possibility of a Fed rate hike.\nInterest rates are lower than at the beginning of the year\nwhich makes stocks more attractive, as does a back-drop of a\ngrowing global economy, said Rahul Shah, chief executive of\nIdeal Asset Management in New York.\n\"We made it through the summer without a significant\ncorrection. As we head into earnings season, there's a potential\nfor the market to go even higher,\" Shah said.\nSome of the big tech companies that form a large part of the\nindexes offer above-average growth at reasonable valuations, he\nsaid. Any dip in the equity market because of North Korean\nmissile tests offer investors a buying opportunity, he said.\n\"They tend to talk loud with their threats,\" Shah said about\nNorth Korea. \"But in terms of the actual commission of those\nthreats, I don't think it's destabilising to the market.\"\nJapan's Nikkei closed 0.5 percent higher and a more\nthan 3 percent jump for the week was its weekly performance\nsince November\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe\ngained 0.11 percent to set a new high for an index that tracks\nthe performance of more than 2,400 stocks in 47 countries.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose\n55.74 points, or 0.25 percent, to 22,259.22. The S&amp;P 500\ngained 1.7 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,497.32 and the Nasdaq\nComposite added 16.33 points, or 0.25 percent, to\n6,445.42.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading\nregional shares lost 0.41 percent to close at 1,495.38.\nU.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in August as Hurricane\nHarvey likely depressed motor vehicle purchases, dropping 0.2\npercent last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast\nretail sales nudging up 0.1 percent.\nThe disappointing U.S. data, which included industrial\noutput in August, came after a report that showed the strongest\nincrease in consumer prices in seven months.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 1\/32\nin price to yield 2.2023 percent.\nA eurozone government bond selloff resumed after hawkish\nrhetoric from a Bank of England policymaker bolstered the notion\nthat central banks across the developed world are moving into\ntightening mode.\nGerman Bunds last fell 1 basis points in price\nto yield 0.433 percent, up from 0.437 percent late on Thursday.\nBrent oil prices, the global benchmark, held near five-month\nhighs and posted their biggest weekly gain since late July.\nU.S. crude settled unchanged at $49.89 per barrel\nand Brent rose 15 cents to settle at $55.51 a barrel.\nThe dollar index fell 0.23 percent, while the euro\nrose 0.15 percent to $1.1936. The Japanese yen weakened\n0.62 percent versus the greenback at 110.91 per $1, and sterling\nlast traded at $1.3567, up 1.28 percent on the day.\nU.S. gold futures fell 0.16 percent to $1,327.20 an\nounce.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
