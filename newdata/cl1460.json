It has almost 5,000 followers and has been mentioned by CNN, the New York Times and Bloomberg. He and his wife, Alina Savra Kraft, live in Bucktown.\n\nWhy did you create the bot?I wanted to make campaign contribution data very accessible to regular people. Most people don't go to the FEC website to find that information. It's also educational. You can see the type of people giving money to Trump.\n\nSuch as? There are lots of doctors, some NASA engineers, a big cross-section of society. I haven't developed data from it.\n\nHave any donors complained?Sure, but that's expected. A lot of people don't realize it is public data. They think I hacked into the database, which isn't true.\n\nAre you running other political bots? I have two fake congressman bots (@RepHalTuring, Republican, and @RepElizaTuring, Democrat). They pull tweets from political commentators, splice them up and randomly put them together so they look like someone tweeting drunk, or weirdly.\n\nDo people get the joke?Not always. Some get into arguments on Twitter, and a New York Times reporter was fooled, briefly.\n\nWhat keeps you up at night?That one of my bots may say something stupid and offend people, maybe something racist. I have safeguards, but it could happen.\n\nIs there money in bots? That would be great, but I make them for fun. I don't see a way to monetize them.\n\nAre you red or blue?I'm a moderate independent, but I tend to vote Democratic.\n\nHow did your childhood inluence who you are?I was born and raised on a 26-acre farm outside Portland, Ore. My mom liked to listen to political folk music from the '60s and talked about opposing the Vietnam War. Dad was a Vietnam veteran. I was a history nerd.\n\nHow nerdy?In grade school I could name my senator and congresspeople, and I liked to read the Oregon voter pamphlet. It has a description of every candidate running for every office and the ballot measures, and any organization can include their arguments for and against.\n\nYour first political soapbox?From second grade through high school, I drew a cartoon called \"Bobcats\" for the Sandy Post, our weekly newspaper. Sometimes it was political. I made $5 each.\n\nYour favorite bot?@Pentametron. It finds pairs of tweets, from two random people, that rhyme in iambic pentameter, and turns them into couplets that sound a bit Shakespearean.\n\nSuch as?\"I wanna hit the gym and eat a lot\/Oh goodness that burrito hit the spot.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 19:44:02.235"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 19:44:01.711","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|dUolor8k7ZoeBQdMPPtFRavyY2U=|RzNKfGygwe2CmfUz9w+B56NescIJZ\/vHF3ZazfDZtlrEn31B3LwfxQ==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/16293516-a848-3162-8f98-a310581b027d","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Software","importance":"1","originalValue":"Software"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/073bb2f5-5fd2-33e7-91e1-9b04c4612f43","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Bots","importance":"1","originalValue":"Bots"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/4f9a3d55-33f5-3738-a2f7-3e9065a5a169","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Computing","importance":"1","originalValue":"Computing"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/adebe2bf-2455-3832-ba38-e773918903c8","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Twitterbot","importance":"2","originalValue":"Twitterbot"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/2021b3a9-eeac-3890-98ce-6367a7a57c7d","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Social networking services","importance":"2","originalValue":"Social networking services"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/26585b85-a498-31bb-abc9-70fdd3d7fb7c","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Social media","importance":"2","originalValue":"Social media"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/7":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/7","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/623b01d7-2221-3867-ad97-cdf343a743f4","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Technology","importance":"2","originalValue":"Technology"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/8":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/SocialTag\/8","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/e1deb7db-1a06-3168-8430-de8619280a93","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Twitter","importance":"2","originalValue":"Twitter"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Newspaper Publishing","rcscode":"B:1458","permid":"4294951543","relevance":0},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/19c47f62-f962-3ee5-ba9d-6b7feb60f6d1\/Industry\/2":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Broadcasting -
