Image courtesy:News18\n\nThe National Award-winning actress was present in Mumbai at the Jagran Cinema Summit on 15 September. During an interaction session there, she was asked about her opinion on feminism and why some people called her a 'man-hater' after her fiery interviews in the last couple of weeks.\n\nIn response to that, Kangana said, \"No, I am not a man-hater for sure... I think feminism is something... a sorry state to be in any society. The gender equality should be there, where feminism doesn't need to act like a medicine on inequality. We should not have feminists, we shouldn't have all these things... We shouldn't have feminism in society.\"\n\nKangana has always made some unusual choices in films -- be it Fashion, Tanu Weds Manu, Queen or Simran -- and has been really bold in making statements on her struggles in her personal and professional life.\n\nAsked about her courage, Kangana said, \"See, a person's opinion shouldn't have to do anything with her profession. My profession should not determine my voice as an individual. I think before an actress, I am a woman and a citizen of this country with a free voice, and my voice should be free from all baggage.\"\n\nPublished Date: Sep 16, 2017 01:06 pm | Updated Date: Sep
