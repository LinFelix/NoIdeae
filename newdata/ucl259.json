He was 91.\nStanton, who appeared in some 70 movies and many television\nshows including \"Repo Man,\" \"Paris, Texas\" and most recently\nDavid Lynch's reboot of television's \"Twin Peaks,\" died\npeacefully at Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, his agent\nJohn Kelly said in a statement.\nStanton's final on-screen role can be seen in the upcoming\nfilm \"Lucky.\"\nIn a career spanning 60 years, Stanton's roles were not\nalways big but were meaningful and could add a special quirk or\nflavor to a film. Sometimes he said very little in his roles,\nbut with a long, craggy face highlighted by unkempt hair and\nsad, droopy eyes, Stanton had a strong physical presence and\nmade a point of not over-acting.\n\"He's one of those actors who knows that his face is the\nstory,\" his friend Sam Shepard, the playwright and actor, said\nin the 2012 documentary \"Harry Dean Stanton: Partly Fiction.\"\nShepard himself passed away in July this year at the age of 73.\nStanton credited Jack Nicholson with giving him vital\nprofessional advice. Nicholson had written a part for Stanton in\nthe Western \"Ride the Whirlwind\" and told him, \"Let the wardrobe\ndo the acting and just play yourself.\"\n\"After Jack said that, my whole approach to acting opened\nup,\" Stanton told Entertainment Weekly.\nStanton worked with many of Hollywood's most notable\ndirectors, including Frances Ford Coppola (\"The Godfather Part\nTwo\" and \"One From the Heart\"), Sam Peckinpah (\"Pat Garrett and\nBilly the Kid\"), Martin Scorsese (\"The Last Temptation of\nChrist\"), Ridley Scott (\"Alien\"), and Lynch (\"Wild at Heart,\"\n\"The Straight Story,\" and \"Inland Empire\").\nStanton could be taciturn to the point of mystery. In\n\"Partly Fiction,\" when Lynch asked him how he would like to be\nremembered, Stanton replied: \"It doesn't matter.\"\nTwo 1984 films cemented his reputation in Hollywood: \"Repo\nMan\" and \"Paris, Texas.\" \"Repo Man\" became an independent cult\nfilm favorite with Stanton as a comically grizzled and paranoid\ncar repossession expert trying to pass on his dubious code of\nethics to his apprentice.\nIn \"Paris, Texas,\" written by Shepard and directed by Wim\nWenders, he played an emotionally broken, nearly silent man\ntrying to put his life and family back together - a portrayal\nthat many in Hollywood thought should have at least earned\nStanton an Oscar nomination.\nOther notable Stanton movies were \"Pretty in Pink,\" \"The\nMissouri Breaks,\" \"Red Dawn,\" \"Escape From New York,\" \"The Green\nMile\" and \"Cool Hand Luke.\"\nIn the 1960s, Stanton was frequently seen on U.S. television\nin classic cowboy shows such as \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Rawhide,\" \"Bonanza\"\nand \"Have Gun, Will Travel.\" In 2008-2009 he played a\nmanipulative polygamist on the HBO series \"Big Love.\"\nStanton was born July 14, 1926, in West Irvine, Kentucky, to\na tobacco farmer father and hairdresser mother who divorced when\nhe was a teenager.\nStanton, who was a cook at the battle of Okinawa during his\nU.S. Navy service in World War Two, became interested in acting\nwhile attending the University of Kentucky and pursued acting at\nthe prestigious Pasadena Playhouse in California.\nIn the 1960s, Stanton and Nicholson were was part of a\nclique of hard-living Hollywood rebels who also included Peter\nFonda, Dennis Hopper and various rock stars. Stanton told an\ninterviewer that he and Hopper had a running joke that some of\nHopper's best work - in \"Blue Velvet\" and an Oscar-nominated\npart in \"Hoosiers\" - came in roles that Stanton had turned down.\nStanton made a second career of music, playing regularly in\nLos Angeles and sometimes touring with the Harry Dean Stanton\nBand, in which he sang and played guitar and harmonica.\nStanton never married but once told an interviewer he had\n\"one, maybe two\" sons.\n(Reporting by Bill Trott; Additional reporting by Piya\nSinha-Roy and Jill Serjeant in Los Angeles;
