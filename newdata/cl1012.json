They are up for grabs to whoever can take them,\" managing director Abdullah al-Shehi told The Associated Press in his Dubai office. He hopes to begin harvesting them by 2019.\n\nIt is perhaps no surprise that the idea would originate in Dubai, which is already famous for its indoor ski slope, artificial islands and the world's tallest building. But the plan to harvest icebergs faces a wide array of legal, financial and logistical hurdles â\" and environmentalists are less than thrilled.\n\nThe firm would send ships down to Heard Island, an Australian nature reserve in the southern Indian Ocean, where they would steer between massive icebergs the size of cities in search of truck-sized chunks known as growlers. Workers would then secure them to the boats with nets and embark on a yearlong cruise to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe company believes that, as most of the icebergs' mass is underwater, they would not melt significantly during the voyage. Al-Shehi said each iceberg would hold around 20 billion gallons of fresh water that could be harvested without costly desalinization, which currently provides nearly all of the Gulf region's water.\n\nMasdar, a government-backed clean energy firm in the United Arab Emirates, is exploring new technologies to meet the country's water needs. The United Arab Emirates' Energy Ministry issued a statement this week denying \"reports\" that an iceberg was in the process of being imported, without specifying the reports to which it referred.\n\nAl-Shehi said his project is a private initiative and that he would seek government approval once his firm completes its feasibility study. He declined to share the company's cost estimates, and said it has not carried out an environmental impact study.\n\nRobert Brears, the founder of the climate think-tank Mitidaption, has studied the feasibility of Antarctic ice harvesting and estimates the project would require an initial outlay of at least $500 million.\n\nThe challenges begin at Heard Island, where Australia strictly limits access in order to preserve the area's rich ecosystem of migratory birds, seals, penguins and fish, which could be disrupted by large ships. Antarctica itself is subject to global treaties that mandate environmental regulations and ban mining and military activities.\n\nEven if the firm secures the necessary approvals from multiple governments, the wrangling itself could prove daunting.\n\n\"There are thousands and thousands of icebergs drifting around and they can move without warning,\" said Christopher Readinger, who heads the Antarctic team at the U.S. National Ice Center. \"Storms down there can be really brutal, and there's really not anyone that can help.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
