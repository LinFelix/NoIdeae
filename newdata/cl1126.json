On its site, WORD explains that the shirt is its contribution toward the fight for better women's healthcare in the U.S. and abroad and that it represents the agency's belief that feminism and human rights should be intersectional. WORD donates twenty five percent of the proceeds from sales of the shirt to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"Maybe they want to capitalize off of feminism,\" Darton said. \"But feminism is not new to me, it's something that I really believe, so to see it being co-opted this way is shocking.\"\n\nForever 21 faced even more harsh criticism from social media users.\n\nCarrasco and Darton said that they were most upset by the fact that the sales of the Forever 21 shirt are only benefiting the retailer instead of the women's health organization. They're considering looking into legal options and have urged the story to donate any proceeds to Planned Parenthood.\n\nForever 21's \"The Woman\" shirt still appeared in searches on the brand's website as of time of writing. However, when we clicked on the shirt, we were directed back to the search page instead of to the product's individual retail page.\n\nMashable has reached out to Forever 21 to ask if customers can still purchase the shirt and if they have a response to the controversy.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
