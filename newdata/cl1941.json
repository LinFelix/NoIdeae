The technology appeared to fail during its first demonstration. Of more concern to many is the problem of users being coerced into looking at their phones and unlocking them, by thieves or law enforcement.\n\nApple says it has safeguards in its Face ID to mitigate abuses. Decided against the X for now as I'm not sure how I feel about face ID yet. Those are legitimate databases of faces that should be far more worrying than Face ID security, because the companies holding those database could be compelled to share them via court order. A number of people have voiced concern that someone stealing the phone could simply point it in the face of the person it was being stolen from, and then have access to everything on the iPhone. This should make it impossible to use the data for marketing or law enforcement purposes. Pre-ordering for both devices will start Friday, and the phones will be available in stores beginning September 22. The new OLED display that Apple refers to as Super Retina Display is already well-know to Android users through the likes of Samsung and others.\n\nAs fears grow over government surveillance, the phrase \"facial recognition\" often triggers a bit of panic in the public, and some commentators are exploiting that fear to overstate any risks associated with Apple's new Face ID security system. Although it works differently to previous facial recognition tech, the concept has a bad reputation and people are alarmed by AI's involvement. The Senator also recognised that the technology and its applications may evolve over time. He also requested information on where Apple obtained the one billion facial images it said it used to train Face ID's AI.\n\n\"If you were in a case where the thief was asking to hand over your phone - you can just reach into your pocket, squeeze it, and it will disable Face ID\", said Federighi. Thanks to the built-in A11 bionic neural engine, Face ID learns your face - new hairstyle, new glasses, new hat or big scarf be damned. It doesn't yet seem to be the instant hit that Touch ID was at launch. The chances of someone else breaking into an iPhone using Face ID was one in a million, 40 times less likely than its current fingerprint mechanism Touch ID, according to Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing. In particular, when those systems are used to perform facial recognition, they have been criticized for being too easy to fool.\n\nThe new Apple Watch Series 3 will be available in two models, one with just Global Positioning System and one with Global Positioning System and cellular capabilities, which will allow users to make and receive calls without having to have their iPhones nearby.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
