The\ncountry triggered a massive debt crisis in the euro zone and had\nto be bailed out three times by other euro zone governments.\n\"Euro for all EU countries? There are clear criteria and\nrules for joining. Greece can not repeat itself,\" Ferber tweeted\nafter the Juncker speech.\nEU officials became concerned that the misreading of the\nJuncker speech in Germany could fuel support for populist and\neurosceptic parties and Juncker aides took to Twitter on Friday\nto try and counter that effect.\nThey stressed that countries would only be allowed into the\nsingle currency if they met economic and governance criteria.\nIn German language-only tweets they also pointed out that\nsome, like keen would-be member Bulgaria, already meet many,\nthough not all, of the economic standards for entry.\nTo adopt the euro, a European Union country has to have low\ninflation, interest rates and debt, a deficit within the EU\nlimits, as well as a stable exchange rate, proven by two years\nspent in the Exchange Rate Mechanism II without severe tensions.\n\"The exchange rate of the Bulgarian Lev is absolutely stable\nto the euro since 2006,\" Juncker's head of cabinet Martin\nSelmayr tweeted. \"The Inflation rate of Bulgaria is just at 0.2\npct and much lower than in the euro area.\"\nAddressing German sensitivity to debt, he tweeted: \"German\ndebt is almost 66 pct of GDP, more than twice as high as the\nBulgarian one.\"\nRomania and Bulgaria meet all the nominal criteria to join\nthe euro except the two-year exchange rate stability test in the\nERM II and the compatibility of their central bank laws with\neuro zone requirements.\nThey are also far from meeting the \"soft\" criterion of real\neconomic convergence with euro zone economies -- a factor that\ncould prevent them getting the go-ahead for adopting the euro.\nCountries outside the euro zone include Bulgaria, Croatia,\nCzech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Denmark and\nBritain, but the last two have a formal opt-out from joining.\nOthers have a legal obligation to adopt the euro when they\nmeet all the criteria, but there are no deadlines for that.\nCommission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said Bulgaria\nhad expressed to him a clear desire to join the euro zone.\nRomania has expressed a similar sentiment.\nBut some of the biggest and more wealthy non-euro members of\nthe EU like Sweden, Poland or the Czech Republic and Hungary\nhave no plans to adopt the currency in the foreseeable future,\npreferring to keep the economic flexibility provided by control\nover their own exchange rate.\n(Additional reporting By Peter Maushagen)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
