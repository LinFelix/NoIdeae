A steady flow of IDPs has arrived from west to east Anbar, from east to west Shirqat, and from Hawiga to west Shirqat and Al-Alam. Confiscation of IDs from all adult male IDPs arriving in east Anbar camps, movement restrictions and limitations on out-of-camp sponsorship are major protection con-cerns in Anbar. Mines and IEDs pose a grave danger to fleeing IDPs from Hawiga through Al-Shirqat and Al-Alam routes.\n\nAffected Population\n\n160,000+ civilians affected from territories controlled by armed extremist groups, in-cluding 75,000 civilians in west Anbar and 85,000 in Hawiga. 1.4 million people cur-rently displaced in Center-South areas.\n\nReturn Population\n\n1.67 million IDPs have returned to their places of origin in Center-South areas.\n\nDisplacement trends and key protection concerns in Anbar\n\nBetween 30 August and 4 September, 315 families (1,900 individuals) arrived to Kilo 18 transit camp, which also serves as a screening centre for IDPs fleeing west Anbar. In the same period, 172 families (1,100 individuals) were relocated from Kilo 18 transit camp to the Ameriyat alFallujah (AAF) camps. According to the Ministry of Migration and Displacement (MoMD), 7,204 families (36,689 individuals) have fled west Anbar since 1 January 2017.\n\nReports from protection partners indicate that security forces continue to confiscate National ID cards at the main AAF checkpoint and upon entry to Habaniya Tourist City (HTC) camp from male IDPs relocated from Kilo 18 transit camp. The IDs are reportedly confiscated for verification against security databases linked to each individual's area of origin. UNHCR and its partners advocate with local authorities and security forces for issuance of receipts whenever civil documents are seized, and for their timely return on grounds that absence of documentation increases protection risks.\n\nSponsorship to new non-camp areas is not permitted for IDPs from west Anbar. Twenty-five to 40 families who are alleged to have links with extremists, as well as those evicted from their homes due to such perceptions, are interned in Kilo 18 transit camp. No sponsorships or freedom of movement outside the camp is permitted for this group.\n\nOn 29 August, a convoy of extremists - including dozens of vehicles - from Deir-ez-Zour in Syria reportedly arrived to the Iraqi-Syrian border, and travelled further east in Anbar to Ru'ua district on the same day. Extremists in west Anbar are reported to have imposed a curfew preventing civilians from leaving Al-Qaim district, Al-Ubaidi sub-district and Akashat area for two days, as they received additional fighters and their families from Deir-ez-Zour and Ninewa. In addition, they are reported to have looted and destroyed 20 houses in Al-Qa'im, Ru'ua and Ana belonging to west Anbar tribal fighters or Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) members in the week of 30 August to 4 September.\n\nOn 30 August, significantly larger than normal movements of Iraqi troops and vehicles were observed in Anbar. On 1 September additional troops started arriving at Ain Al-Asad base in Al -Baghdadi in preparation for west Anbar operations. At the same time, vehicle movements through Al-Suqour checkpoint - located between Baghdad and AAF - were suspended without prior announcement. This resulted in heightened scrutiny and long delays for civilians and humanitarian goods passing through the checkpoint, generating considerable confusion and frustration. Although the Al-Suqour checkpoint was reopened under instructions from the new Governor of Anbar it is uncertain if similar closures will be instituted upon commencement of the west Anbar operation.\n\nBetween 4 - 5 September, three counter-terrorism operations were conducted by security forces, resulting in arrests of nine extremists suspected of planning suicide attacks in Ramadi and Heet. Fear of suicide attacks remains high among Anbar residents as extremists have announced their intention to target public areas.\n\nDisplacement trends and key protection concerns in Kirkuk\n\nIn the reporting period, 32 IDP families (195 individuals) arrived to Kirkuk camps. Of these, 28 families (121 individuals) crossed through Daquq checkpoint and were transported to Daquq camp. Two families (14 individuals) crossed through Maktab Khalid checkpoint, and two families (10 individuals) crossed through Debis checkpoint. Meanwhile, 30 individuals crossed through Debis checkpoint and settled in Sayadah neighbourhood inside Kirkuk. Twenty other individuals were released from security screening at Debis checkpoint and transported to Laylan 1 and Nazrawa camps to join their families. The number of arrivals during this period is smaller than past weeks, likely due to families not moving as they knew the waiting period would be longer due to absence of officials over Eid. The new arrivals were all from Hawiga, except two families (11 individuals) from Al-Ba'aj in Ninewa, and two families (7 individuals) from Balad in Salah al-Din.\n\nMilitary reinforcements continued to arrive at Qayyarah Military Base in Ninewa, in preparation for the Hawiga and east Shirqat operations, which are anticipated to start by midSeptember. From 2-3 September, Coalition forces undertook airstrikes targeting extremist positions in Hawiga. At the same time, media and local sources in Kirkuk and Hawiga reported that disagreements within extremist group leadership in Hawiga were leading some of their members to surrender to Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). Meanwhile, attacks on houses of extremist leaders in Hawiga are reported to have escalated, with the latest such incident occurring on 4 September - resulting in the imposition of a curfew by extremists in the eastern neighborhoods of Hawiga.\n\nDisplacement trends and key protection concerns in Salah al-Din\n\nFrom 30 August to 7 September, 1,152 individuals fled east Shirqat towards west Shirqat, undergoing security screening in Jumaila public hall; and 204 families and 3 individuals fled Hawiga to west Shirqat\/Al-Alam camps, undergoing security screening in Jumaila public hall\/Al-Hayakil screening site. Some families were admitted to Al-Karama camp bringing the total number of IDPs there to 712 families. Others were received in Al-Alam camps, bringing the total number of IDPs there to 581 families (Al-Alam 1) and 832 families (Al-Alam 2), respectively. Following security screening, 184 individuals from east Shirqat were approved to settle with relatives in west Shirqat, while 43 families plus 5 individuals were permitted to reside with relatives in Tikrit, AlAlam and Rubeida village.\n\nIDPs perceived to be affiliated with extremists continue to be detained at screening sites and at Al-Aqwas checkpoint, north of Tikrit, and taken to Al-Shahama camp which hosts 128 families. On the other hand, in the reporting period, five families were released from Al-Shahama Camp after their return requests were approved by the Salah al-Din Operations Commander. The families have returned to Shirqat, Samara, Deloiyah. According to ISF, on 6 September three IDPs from Hawiga were injured by IEDs in Mekhol mountain range, north of Salah al-Din, during their flight to safety. They were taken to Al-Shirqat Hospital.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 20:05:28.036"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 20:05:27.064","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|EzK\/BBXTyzbdREXiEOYT8mKQnfM=|XfXJQOW1fLhv67suyp\/qK90VvydHNiuQqi1v7QTZkIQt+oZe6uUcKA==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/172828a8-381d-33de-a365-f502eadfd994\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.837,"name":"War_Conflict"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/172828a8-381d-33de-a365-f502eadfd994\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/172828a8-381d-33de-a365-f502eadfd994\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/172828a8-381d-33de-a365-f502eadfd994\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/9615baf5-69bf-374c-92a5-3d505753c0d0","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Al-Shirqat","importance":"1","originalValue":"Al-Shirqat"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/172828a8-381d-33de-a365-f502eadfd994\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/172828a8-381d-33de-a365-f502eadfd994\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/28542e40-48b9-3154-8ee1-53763dfa72b8","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Fallujah","importance":"1","originalValue":"Fallujah"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/172828a8-381d-33de-a365-f502eadfd994\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/172828a8-381d-33de-a365-f502eadfd994\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/45c50930-6538-3a50-99a2-7746fd3b3a5b","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Geography of Asia","importance":"1","originalValue":"Geography of Asia"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/172828a8-381d-33de-a365-f502eadfd994\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/172828a8-381d-33de-a365-f502eadfd994\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/d44ae395-23ce-3e2a-aad2-54ec100cbc72","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Geography of Iraq","importance":"2","originalValue":"Geography of Iraq"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/172828a8-381d-33de-a365-f502eadfd994\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/172828a8-381d-33de-a365-f502eadfd994\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/087763f8-a6c8-3617-900c-aab09427f17b","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Military history by country","importance":"2","originalValue":"Military history by country"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/172828a8-381d-33de-a365-f502eadfd994\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/172828a8-381d-33de-a365-f502eadfd994\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/8fd0f727-0ad4-357b-8db2-a70c4bb33cb0","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Al Khadraniyah","importance":"2","originalValue":"Al Khadraniyah"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/172828a8-381d-33de-a365-f502eadfd994\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Construction Materials -
