We need to collaborate with good understanding,\" Zaw\nHtay told Reuters on Saturday.\nBangladesh has for decades faced influxes of Rohingya\nfleeing persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where the\nRohingya are regarded as illegal migrants and denied\ncitizenship.\nBangladesh was already home to 400,000 Rohingya before the\nlatest crisis erupted on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents\nattacked about 30 police posts and an army camp, killing a dozen\npeople.\nThe Myanmar security forces responded with what rights\nmonitors and fleeing Rohingya say is a campaign of violence and\narson aimed at driving out the Muslim population.\nThe conflict has led to a humanitarian crisis on both sides\nof the border and raised questions about Myanmar's path under\nthe leadership of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi after nearly\n50 years of strict military rule.\nThe generals still control national security policy but\nnevertheless, Suu Kyi has been widely criticised abroad for not\nstopping or condemning the violence.\nThere is little sympathy for the Rohingya in a country where\nthe end of military rule has unleashed old animosities and the\nmilitary campaign in Rakhine State is widely supported.\n\n'STRONGHOLD'\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N.\nSecurity Council have urged Myanmar to end the violence, which\nhe said was best described as ethnic cleansing.\nMyanmar rejects the accusations, saying its security forces\nare carrying out clearance operations to defend against the\ninsurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which\nclaimed responsibility for the Aug. 25 attacks and similar,\nthough smaller, attacks in October.\nThe government has declared ARSA a terrorist organisation\nand accused it of setting the fires and attacking civilians.\nThe ARSA says it is fighting for the rights of Rohingya and\nhas denied links to foreign Islamists.\nMyanmar's army chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, said\nthe violence - 93 clashes since Aug. 25 - was a bid by the\ninsurgents to \"build a stronghold\", according to speech to\nofficer trainees, posted on a military Facebook page.\nMin Aung Hlaing called on the military to abide by all laws\nand regulations, including the Geneva Conventions, and said the\nmedia should be united and the people should not \"rely on\nforeign organisations\". He did not elaborate.\nMore than 430 people have been killed, most of them\ninsurgents, and about 30,000 non-Muslim villagers have been\ndisplaced, the government said. Dozens of places have been\nburned and nearly half of the 471 villages in the north of\nRakhine had been completely or partly deserted, it said.\nThe United States has called for the protection of civilians\nand a deputy assistant secretary of state, Patrick Murphy, is\ndue in Myanmar next week.\nChina, which also vies for influence in Myanmar, joined a\nU.N. Security Council call for an end to the violence while its\nambassador in Myanmar expressed his support for the government's\naction, Myanmar media reported.\nEthnic cleansing is not recognised as a separate crime under\ninternational law but allegations of ethnic cleansing as part of\nwider, systematic human rights violations have been heard in\ninternational courts.\nSeparately, the Committee to Protect Journalists has called\non Bangladesh to release two Myanmar journalists detained last\nweek while covering the refugee crisis. A police official told\nReuters the two were found to be working on tourist visas and\npolice were investigating.\n(Additional reporting by Shoon Naing in YANGON, Serajul Quadir\nin DHAKA; Writing by
