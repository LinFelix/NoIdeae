But\nthings have changed,\" said Leopoldo Attolico, the Italy country\nmanager for Citi, which has 200 Milan staff and expects some\nworkers to seek relocation from London.\n\"Now there is a sense of insecurity among non-UK nationals\nworking in London and we have seen more interest in relocating\nto Milan, also thanks to new fiscal incentives.\"\nFor those returning, Italy is offering significant perks,\nincluding a 50 percent income tax break. There is no mass\nexodus, however, with only dozens of Italians choosing to\nrelocate so far.\nBut the shift points to a growing fragmentation of the\nEuropean investment banking sector, which has been almost\nexclusively concentrated in London for the past 20 years.\nAs Brexit nears, more financiers are expected to shift to\ntheir home countries or to other financial hubs like Frankfurt\nand Paris. This would increasingly spell the end of a model that\nhas allowed banks to streamline operations and costs by covering\nEuropean markets out of Britain.\n\"You don't move back to Italy to get a tax break, but it's a\ngood incentive when you're thinking about your next step,\" said\nformer DBAY investment adviser Raffaele Petrone who returned to\nItaly in February to join private equity firm Armonia SGR.\n\nTAX HEAVEN\nAntonino Mattarella, nephew of Italian president Sergio\nMattarella, is also among bankers making the switch. In February\nthe 38-year-old, who spent 12 years in London at Goldman Sachs,\nbecame Bank of America's Italy head in Milan.     \nSome private equity and hedge fund executives have shifted\ntoo.\nGiuseppe Prestia, partner at Charterhouse, has just\nrelocated to Milan after handling the private equity house's\nItalian investments out of London for 13 years, and his firm is\nconsidering opening its own base in Italy, according to the\nsources.\nLondon-based buyout funds Cinven and Advent have started\nbeefing up their Milan subsidiaries, with Advent director\nFrancesco Casiraghi being the first to relocate, they said.\nOver the past two decades, thousands of graduates have left\nItaly due to a lack of work and career prospects, with London a\nfavourite destination.\nIn a bid to reverse this brain drain the government has\nintroduced the 50 percent, five-year income tax break for\nhigh-skilled Italian workers returning from abroad, as well as a\nflat tax rate of 100,000 euros on foreign income aimed at luring\nthe wealthy of all nationalities.\nFabrizio Pagani, chief of staff for Italy's finance\nminister, has been organising international events to promote\nMilan as a financial centre. \"We have seen a lot of interest\naround these new fiscal policies, especially the one offering a\n50 percent tax holiday,\" he said.\n\nLIFESTYLE MATTERS\nMilan still has a long way to go to come close to rivalling\nLondon or New York. Its share of global foreign currency trading\nis 0.3 percent compared with 36.9 percent in London, according\nto the Bank for International Settlements, while Italy lags\nBritain, France and Germany for investment banking fees.\nBut there are other attractions for affluent financiers.\nKnown as a hub for world-class design, fashion and food, the\ncity of 1.3 million people boasts 17 Michelin-starred\nrestaurants among about 7,000 bars, cafes and eateries. It is\nalso marketing itself as a modern banking centre with the newly\ndeveloped Porta Nuova financial district reshaping the skyline.\n\"More than 6 billion euros has been invested in office space\nin Italy over the past 24 months, a significant part of which\nwent to Porta Nuova,\" said Manfredi Catella, CEO of real estate\ninvestment firm Coima.\nApartments in prime areas like the Brera district cost about\n$12,000 per square metre versus an average of $25,000 in\nLondon's exclusive Mayfair.\n\"For someone from London buying in Milan is like going to\nthe supermarket,\" said Vincenzo Albanese, CEO of estate agency\nSigest.\nAlbanese said financial-sector workers in London had been\nsounding out the Milan property market over the past year with\ntop-floor terraced apartments in high demand.\nInternational schools are also reporting a pick-up in\ninterest.\n\"We had a lot of interest from Italians working in London\nwho decided it was time to come back. This has been a trend\nsince Brexit,\" said Chris Greenhalgh, principal at the British\nSchool of Milan.\nGreenhalgh said Milan's municipality recently gathered all\ninternational schools and asked them to provide details about\ntheir capacity as part of a pitch to lure people from London.\nSt Louis School recently added a third school to its Milan\nnetwork in expectation of a boom in demand from returning\nItalians, converting a former monastery into a 600-place school.\n($1 = 0.8408 euros; 0.7566 pounds)\n(Reporting By Pamela Barbaglia and Stephen Jewkes; Editing by\nPravin
