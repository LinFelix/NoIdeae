Unfortunately, it was never used,\" Heidecker wrote on his Bandcamp.\n\nWith his pitch-perfect Dylan impersonation, Heidecker sings on the track \"Fake news about the environment \/ Global warming it's a hoax \/ Job killing regulations killing regular folks \/ Small business man is overtaxed ain't no way he can hire \/ Ain't never been a time when things have been so dire.\"\n\n\"Bob Dylan's Trump Campaign Song\" is available to download now for $1, with all proceeds going toward hurricane relief.\n\nOver the years, the Tim & Eric star has spoofed both Dylan and Trump in song: In 2012, Heidecker mocked Dylan's epic 14-minute song about the Titanic with a 15-minute track titled \"Bob Dylan's Titanic.\" Heidecker's \"Talkin' Nobel Prize,\" a nonchalant response to the prestigious honor, followed in October 2016.\n\nThe comedian has also poked fun at Trump with songs like the \"Margaritaville\"-aping \"Mar-a-Lago,\" about Trump's Florida resort, as well as \"Trump's Pilot\" and \"Trump Talkin' Nukes.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
