Kunene has been ordered to pay the legal costs of the case.\n\nSpeaking outside court, Kunene said that his legal team may appeal the ruling after studying the judgment. He said that they would abide by the ruling and remove the videos and photographs within the next hour.\n\n\"We expected this judgment from her hostility toward our counsel during the proceedings,\" he said.\n\nKunene said that he accepted that Keightley had to weigh up the constitutionally guaranteed right of freedom of expression against the right to privacy.\n\nHe said that it was an important judgment with regard to the precedent set on media and the privacy of ordinary citizens. Kunene said that he was happy that his credible online newspaper was allowed to keep the story up, but that they would abide by the order.\n\n\"There are over 100 videos and photos that we have, but obviously we have to make sure that we lock them far away because the order has been made that we must never use them and we are going to respect that order,\" he said.\n\nKunene said that Ramaphosa can never speak from a moral standing after soliciting such salacious pictures from the woman.\n\nThe woman's attorney Nomaswazi Maseko said that they welcomed the judgment and that they were still in consultation with their client regarding the steps going forward. \"There's a violation in terms of the privacy and dignity as well and even though it's alleged that there was a public interest or a public figure associated with her, it's still an allegation at this point,\" she said. -- AP","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
