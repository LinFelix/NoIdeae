One potential opportunity to use abandoned properties is to urge people to become small business owners as secondary income with a growing opportunity in their back yards that could include high tunnels, which are unheated greenhouses that can help commercial farmers extend their growing season to improve profitability and productivity.\n\n\"The third component is to develop an aggregate by which these small growers can create a consortium to sell on enough volume to make an impact on the food system in the community - for example institutional customers or school systems,\" Wood said.\n\nThe Mansfield campus has received a $100,000 grant from the OSU President and Provost Council on Sustainability to develop a demonstration micro farm. The project is being built with raised beds on unused parking lots to mimic an industrial site or an urban community that can be used as an educational demonstration space for both OSU students and the community.\n\nAccording to Wood, the next step is a planning grant that is expected to be awarded later this month to put the same type of system in schools to support STEM and STEAM learning, help with nutrition issues and put sustainability into school food programs. Officials also are looking at micro farms as an economic renewal tool to help high poverty residents overcome personal issues and learn growing and aggregating skills.\n\n\"This planning process will be launched in October with (community) symposiums in December and two or three possible projects emerging in January or February,\" Wood said. \"After that, we're going to look for USDA funding to make it a two to three year project.\"\n\nWood said OSU plans to deploy student teams to assess some 5,600 abandoned properties that are in various stages of foreclosure and asked the Land Bank to help with some of the data collection and analysis. She indicated the university would be asking for financial help with the assessments but did not mention a specific figure.\n\n\"We're looking for Land Bank engagement so this will be a community solution, not just an OSU solution,\" Wood added.\n\nLand Bank board member and county commissioners' chairwoman Marilyn John said officials have had preliminary discussions on the OSU program and believe there could be some properties in Land Bank focus areas that could be combined for specific projects.\n\nIn other business, the Land Bank staff reported on some of the things they learned during a statewide Land Bank conference Sept. 11-13 in Cleveland. Topics that have potential for local use included incentives to help revitalize distressed neighborhoods, ways to take back properties when rehab projects fail, the use of demolition project managers and a projection showing the future of land banks may be to deal with brownfield industrial sites and abandoned gas stations.\n\nOn a separate issue, administrator Amy Hamrick reported that testing has turned up no contamination from old gas tanks that were removed from the former Sallies' Wholesale Construction at 728 Park Avenue East. She said the site should be cleared for development once officials once officials look into a neighbor's comment that there might be one more tank still buried on the property.\n\nThompson Memorials in Perrysville wants to obtain the property and use the large building that was built in 1973 for its countertop division because it has room to display granite slabs used on some of its projects.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http:\/\/ohne.ws\/2y5yAOz","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
