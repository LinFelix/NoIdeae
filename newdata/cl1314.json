Companies such as Google and Facebook have acknowledged that few women hold upper-management positions at their companies. Ride-sharing company Uber, where a culture of abusive behavior contributed to the downfall of founder Travis Kalanick, has been accused by some female engineers of a pattern of sexual harassment.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim in the latest Google lawsuit that they were steered onto career tracks with lower compensation and advancement opportunities, despite having skills similar to male colleagues placed in higher positions. The plaintiffs also allege women working at Google are promoted less frequently and at a slower rate than similarly qualified male counterparts.\n\n\"Google has discriminated and continues to discriminate against its female employees by systematically paying them lower compensation than Google pays to male employees performing substantially similar work under similar working conditions,\" the three plaintiffs say.\n\nALSO READ: Top Analyst Has 10 Incredible Internet Predictions for 2017 and Beyond\n\nThe suit follows a federal labor probe that made a preliminary finding of pay bias among the 21,000 employees at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California. Google is required to submit to federal audits in regard to pay equity because it is a federal contractor.\n\nGoogle disputes those findings and says its analysis shows no gender pay gap.\n\nIn addition, Google might face another class-action lawsuit that has nothing to do with gender bias. James Damore, the former engineer fired for comments about Google's culture, believes the company discriminated against him for his political beliefs. He has filed a complaint to the National Labor Review Board and is weighing legal action.\n\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter\n\nterms and conditions\n\nBy John
