Ryan Sartor (@ryansartor) has that story. Buzz60\n\n2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nWASHINGTON -- With less than two weeks left in the GOP's campaign to repeal Obamacare, Sen. Bill Cassidy and a small group of senators are pushing a last-ditch effort to pass legislation.\n\nThe measure, introduced by Cassidy and fellow Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Dean Heller of Nevada and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin would give states block grants to decide their own health insurance systems.\n\nThe senators say that if states want to keep their Obamacare programs, they can, and if they want to repeal and do an entirely new system, they can also do that. Most of the taxes that are part of Obamacare would remain in place to provide funding for the block grants.\n\n\"You've got to give the power to patients,\" Cassidy told a group of reporters Friday. \"You have to give the patients to states.\"\n\nMORE: Republicans pinning Obamacare repeal hopes on one more health care bill\n\nSenators are running short on time because the budget procedure they would use to pass the legislation with a simple majority will expire at the end of the month.\n\n\"It appears that the repeal and replacement of Obamacare is dead, unless the Senate can act by the end of the month,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, told USA TODAY recently\n\nMeadows, who chairs the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus, was a key player in a compromise amendment that ultimately brought on dozens of conservatives and got the repeal-and-replace legislation through the House in May.\n\n\"All hopes are on Sen. Graham and his willingness to move something through the Senate; outside of that, it's not looking very optimistic,\" Meadows continued.\n\nGraham and Cassidy met recently with Vice President Mike Pence on Capitol Hill to discuss their proposal and also participated in a conference call with governors.\n\nTheir effort got a boost Wednesday when President Donald Trump applauded Cassidy and Graham for working \"toward a solution to relieve the disastrous Obamacare burden on the American people.\"\n\nCassidy, a physician, told USA TODAY he and other sponsors are trying to drum up support, including among governors who, he said, can wield influence with senators.\n\n\"It will take both the president committed to it but also probably the governors because everybody understands that governors are the ones who implement this, and if they sign off, I think folks can be comfortable,\" said Cassidy, who serves on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who backs the bill, said Trump's support helps their effort. \"The president's interest in this indicates that it has a chance,\" he said.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said recently he liked the proposal, but he cautioned he would not commit to supporting it without seeing the final legislation and talking to Arizona's governor.\n\nMcCain cast the critical vote that killed the Senate effort for a scaled-down repeal at the end of July.\n\n\"I want to see the final legislation and understand its impact on the state of Arizona before taking a position,\" McCain said. \"Any effort to replace Obamacare must be done through the regular order of committee hearings, open debate and amendments from both sides of the aisle.\"\n\nBut regular order takes time, and there are just a couple weeks left to pass a bill under budget reconciliation rules.\n\nAfter the ability to use reconciliation ends, senators would have to go back to the usual requirement of getting 60 votes in order for health care legislation to pass -- an almost impossible task given Democrats have been united against any efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Republicans have 52 seats in the Senate, with Democrats and independents holding 48.\n\n\"The clock is ticking -- Sept. 30 with this reconciliation vehicle,\" said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, a member of Republican leadership. \"In order to use that a lot has to happen. I think it's a kind of a double bank shot that that could get done.\"\n\nRead More: Trump pushes plan by Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy to replace parts of Obamacare\n\nMore: Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy have an alternate heath care plan. Here's how it wor\n\nMore: Cassidy gets out front on GOP health care plan\n\nCassidy said Friday the number of supporters is edging closer to 50, noting the recent support of GOP Sens. Roy Blunt of Missouri and John Barasso of Wyoming.\n\n\"I'm pretty confident we'll get there on the Republican side,\" Cassidy said. \"People are coming out regularly and saying they're for it, either privately or publicly.\"\n\nThe measure, however, has yet to pick up Democratic support.\n\nLouisiana Democrats slammed the GOP plan, saying residents would suffer. Gov. John Bel Edwards expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"This harmful bill will end Medicaid as we know it, cancel tax credits that help families afford health insurance and eliminate subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket costs for working families,\" Stephen Handwerk, executive director of the Louisiana Democratic Party, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThere is another effort underway in Congress that is bipartisan.\n\nSens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the H.E.L.P. Committee, and Patty Murray, D-Wash., the panel's ranking member, have crafted a plan that would keep Obamacare in place, but would provide a short-term fix for the individual market in hopes of bringing down insurance costs for millions of Americans.\n\nThey expected to unveil their bill early next week. The committee has held four hearings in the last two weeks.\n\nCassidy said the measures aren't competing.\n\nMeanwhile, he said, lawmakers are looking to get the Graham\/Cassidy measure scored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office possibly and go through the legislative process in the next two weeks.\n\n\"There seems to be some hope, not a lot, but you can bet we're pushing it hard,\" Marilyn Musgrave, vice president of government affairs at Susan B. Anthony List and a former congresswoman, told USA TODAY.\n\nSBA List is an anti-abortion organization that is pushing Graham-Cassidy because it includes a provision that would defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nNot everyone is convinced.\n\n\"There are a lot of different ideas that have been brought up at the the committee,\" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a member of the HELP Committee, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nThe most interest, she said, seems to be in modest legislation to stabilize the insurance markets in order to lower premiums, an idea that has been the focus of hearings before the HELP Committee this week.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who is also on the HELP panel and is a former governor, said he doesn't expect movement any time soon on the Graham-Cassidy bill.\n\n\"It will be part of the longer-term discussion,\" Kaine said earlier this month. \"That proposal hurts Virginia pretty badly, so that's not going to be one that I support.\"\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, said during a recent HELP committee hearing he doesn't support the Graham\/Cassidy bill, which he said would cost his state billions of dollars over the next four or five years.\n\nFrederick Isasi, executive director of Families USA, said the Graham\/Cassidy plan for block grant funding would be harmful to low and moderate-income families.\n\n\"The cuts in the Graham-Cassidy proposals are just as harsh and extreme as any of the repeal proposals that the Senate rejected over the summer,\" Isasi said in recent statement.\n\nCassidy said he and other supporters are still shooting for action by the end of the month.\n\n\"Of course if we don't get it through now, we'd like to do it in the future,\" he said. \"But we are thinking that we can get this done by Sept. 30.\"\n\nMichael Collins of USA TODAY contributed to this report.\n\n2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story:
