Speaking online Witness Dingani confirmed about the newly formed project, he added that \"As someone who is always working in the society ,it is very wise to compile our history because if one dies the history is being lost .People they try to compile down their history ,the very good example is the existence of diaries\". The project is mostly to inspire people at the same time educating the coming generation .\n\n\"We have done everything and we have employed few people who will be in the field as they will be responsible in both interviewing people and typing the same information,there is a lot we have done so far .Some of the coming projects will include the society\" added Derco Denzel Gabaza who is the
