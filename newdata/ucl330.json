The Guptas and\ntheir companies have not been charged with any crime, but the\nscandal is one of many that have dogged the Zuma presidency.\n\n\"FAILINGS\"\n\"I want to apologise to the public, our people and clients\nfor the failings that have been identified by the\ninvestigation,\" said KPMG's new South African CEO, Nhlamu Dlomu.\nKPMG said it would donate 40 million rand ($3 million)\nearned in fees from Gupta-controlled firms to education and\nanti-corruption groups, and refund 23 million rand it had\nreceived for the tax service report.\nThe chief executive of KPMG South Africa, Trevor Hoole, its\nchairman, Ahmed Jaffer, chief operating officer Steven Louw and\nfive senior partners all resigned.\n\"I absolutely understand that ultimate responsibility lies\nwith me,\" Hoole said in a statement.\nKPMG also plans to dismiss Jacques Wessels, the lead partner\non audits of Gupta-linked firms, it said. Wessels did not answer\na call to his mobile phone seeking comment.\nAndrew Cranston, former CEO of KPMG Russia, has been\nappointed as interim chief operating officer.\nThe announcement stunned hundreds of KPMG staff crammed into\nan auditorium in its Johannesburg head offices and others\nlistening in via video link from Cape Town and Pretoria.\n\"Everybody is just dumbfounded,\" said one employee, who\nasked not to be named. \"They're obviously trying to show that\nresponsibility stretches to the top. But right now I don't think\nanybody knows what to think.\"\nGordhan, one of the Guptas' harshest critics, lamented the\ndamage done to the credibility of the tax service, an\ninstitution that has been vital to South Africa's stability and\neconomic growth in the two decades since apartheid.\n\"Whilst there have been personal consequences, the real\nissue that confronts us is the significant damage to our\nhard-won democracy, to our state institutions and ultimately to\nthe South African people,\" he said in a statement.\n\nCALL FOR INVESTIGATION\nMmusi Maimane, leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance,\ncalled for a criminal probe into \"state capture\", a term used to\nrefer to the Guptas' alleged undue influence over government\ndecision-making.\n\"KPMG must be subject to a full investigation both locally\nand internationally,\" he told Reuters.\nThe firm is under investigation by the IRBA, a South African\nregulatory body, and could be removed from the auditors'\nregister, an outcome that would have a devastating impact on its\nAfrican business.\nThe three Gupta brothers, Atul, Ajay and Rajesh, came to\nSouth Africa in the early 1990s and built a commercial empire\nstretching from computers to mining and media.\nThe family has employed Zuma's son Duduzane as a director of\none of its subsidiaries. The brothers have rejected the public\nwatchdog's accusations of corruptly influencing Zuma.\nOn Tuesday, the British arm of Bell Pottinger folded after\nclients deserted it because of a backlash over a racially\ncharged political campaign it had run for the Guptas.\nMcKinsey is also being investigated by South Africa's\nparliament over whether it knowingly let funds from the state\npower utility Eskom be diverted to a Gupta company as a way of\nsecuring a $78 million contract to advise Eskom.\nMcKinsey is carrying out its own investigation, but has\ndenied wrongdoing.\nThe Gupta scandals have piled pressure on Zuma and opened\nrifts in the African National Congress, the party that has ruled\nsince the end of apartheid in 1994. It is due to elect a new\nparty leader in December.\n($1 = 13.1966 rand)\n(Reporting by Joe Brock, Ed Cropley, TJ Strydom, Olivia\nKumwenda-Mtambo, Mfuneko Toyana and Nqobile Dludla; Writing by\nJoe
