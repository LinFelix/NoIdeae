We need to collaborate with good understanding,\" Zaw\nHtay told Reuters.\nBangladesh has for decades faced influxes of Rohingya\nfleeing persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where the\nRohingya are regarded as illegal migrants and denied\ncitizenship.\nBangladesh was already home to 400,000 Rohingya before the\nlatest crisis erupted on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents\nattacked about 30 police posts and an army camp, killing a dozen\npeople.\nThe Myanmar security forces responded with what rights\nmonitors and fleeing Rohingya say is a campaign of violence and\narson aimed at driving out the Muslim population.\n\nHUMANITARIAN CRISIS\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N.\nSecurity Council have urged Myanmar to end the violence, which\nhe said was best described as ethnic cleansing.\nMyanmar rejects the accusations, saying its security forces\nare carrying out clearance operations to defend against the\ninsurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which\nclaimed responsibility for the Aug. 25 attacks and similar,\nthough smaller, attacks in October.\nThe government has declared ARSA a terrorist organisation\nand accused it of setting the fires and attacking civilians.\nAbout 30,000 non-Muslim villagers have also been displaced\nin the conflict in which Myanmar says more than 430 people have\nbeen killed, most of them insurgents.\nNearly half of 471 villages in the north of its Rakhine\nState had been completely deserted or partly abandoned, the\ngovernment said.\nThe ARSA has denied links to foreign Islamists and has\ncalled for neighbouring countries to block any foreign\n\"terrorists\" from trying to join it. It says it is fighting for\nthe rights of Rohingya.\nThe conflict has led to a humanitarian crisis on both sides\nof the border and raised questions about Myanmar's transition\nunder the leadership of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi after\nnearly 50 years of strict military rule.\nThe generals still control national security policy but\nnevertheless, Suu Kyi has been widely criticised abroad for not\nstopping or condemning the violence.\nThere is little sympathy for Rohingya in a country where the\nend of military rule has unleashed some old communal animosities\nand the military campaign in Rakhine State is generally\nsupported.\nEthnic cleansing is not recognised as a separate crime under\ninternational law but allegations of ethnic cleansing as part of\nwider, systematic human rights violations have been heard in\ninternational courts.\nRights group Amnesty International said on Friday evidence\npointed to a \"mass-scale scorched-earth campaign\" across the\nnorth of Rakhine that was unmistakably ethnic cleansing.\n(Additional reporting by Shoon Naing in YANGON; Writing by\nRobert Birsel; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
