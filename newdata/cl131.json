It said the Orlando and Tampa products terminals and their associated truck racks, the Central Florida Pipeline (CFPL), Elba Island LNG Terminal, the Plantation Pipe Line system, and other terminals in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina are fully operational.\nDominican Republican Refidomsa's Haina refinery and its docks returned to normal after Irma, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nStatoil  said operations at South Riding Point resumed earlier this week after being shut down during the weekend. \nBuckeye Partners LP did not immediately have an update available on its Bahamas crude oil and fuel terminal, previously known as Borco.\nThe terminal is Buckeye's largest and can store about 26.2 million barrels of oil, fuel oil, gasoline and other products. Buckeye's terminals in Puerto Rico have returned to normal, a spokesman told Reuters in an email.\nPort Everglades, South Florida's main petroleum delivery hub, said it is open with no restrictions. Of the 12 petroleum terminals supplying transportation fuels, 10 were up and delivering fuel to retail stations and two that are still working to reopen have water intrusion and related issues, the Port said.\nIrma, which had ranked as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record before striking the U.S. mainland as a Category 4 hurricane on Sunday, has been blamed for at least 82 deaths, with several hard-hit Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, accounting for more than half the fatalities. \n\nREFINERIES: \n\n           COMPANY             LOCATION
