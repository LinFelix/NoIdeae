Either people love it or hate it, but they can't ignore it.\n\nBut what happens when you get your equation wrong in the math class?\n\nSimple, if you are a minister, you actually tell the teacher that she is wrong.\n\nUttarakhand Education Minister Arvind Pandey is the 'student' who got his math wrong and in turn insulted the teacher.\n\nAccording to media reports, a video surfaced online that showed Pandey giving out his bizarre theory.\n\nThe minister was visiting a school in Dehradun where he was seen insulting a class teacher.\n\nHe questioned the teacher what would be the answer of (-) + (-). She replied the answer to be negative.\n\nHe not only insulted the teacher but also justified his theory. According to Pandey, (-) + (-)= (+) in mathematics but (-) in Chemistry, after the teacher said she is a science teacher and not maths.\n\nShe had given a right answer but the overbearing nature of
