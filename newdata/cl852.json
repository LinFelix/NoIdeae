That's how serious it is.\"\n\nWhile Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has pledged to veto the budget, citing the cuts to higher education, Herbst said this does not completely assuage her concerns.\n\n\"It's not done 'til it's done\" she said. \"I know that the governor and many others will fight for the university. The veto is the first step and then, I assume, there's negotiations to come.\"\n\nIn an email sent to the UConn community Saturday morning, Herbst detailed a long list of cutbacks the approved budget would require, including closing regional campuses and multiple academic departments and the eliminating scores of majors and graduate programs.\n\nShe also said it also would mean dramatically larger classes and wait lists, making it harder for students to graduate within four years. And she said it would lead to major reductions to need- and merit-based financial aid, devastating cuts to scientific and medical research programs, the reduction of UConn police and fire services and the elimination of most student health and mental health services.\n\nAnd she said it would mean closing UConn Health in Farmington, or large parts of it, and eliminating many Division 1 athletic programs.\n\nAsked if the cuts could threaten basketball, Herbst said she isn't sure, but \"everything is on the table.\"\n\nThe approved budget also would require all full-time UConn professors to teach an additional course to save $10.4 million annually.\n\n\"That's a contractual matter,\" Herbst said, \"so I don't know how that gets reopened.\" She added that requiring faculty to do more teaching would mean less research gets done, and less federal money coming n to finance research.\n\n\"And there goes our economic development,\" she said.\n\n\"The truth is, if you boost faculty workload in a way that is above what every other research university asks for then faculty don't have to stay here,\" she said. \"Our best faculty will leave. They will go to other flagships where they have a normal workload.\"\n\nHerbst said she is baffled about why legislators would pass such a budget after the state has invested heavily in improving the university. Just last week, she noted, the U.S. News & World Report gave UConn it's highest ranking ever: 18th in the nation among public universities.\n\n\"The key point is that the massive investment over decades that Connecticut has made in this university has worked,\" Herbst said. \"We now have a fabulous Number 18 university that is attracting great students, that is ramping up research, that is critical to the future of the Connecticut economy in the biosciences, in manufacturing, in all sorts of areas. So you are just getting there, just starting to see the success in these tremendous material benefits in Connecticut and now you are taking that all away.\"\n\n\"It will be mind boggling how quickly we will go down these rankings,\" Herbst said, predicting the university would decline to the forties within a few years.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 20:15:07.189"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 20:15:06.672","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|6kNqtf6gfvblCedbk+\/MHFRfBgQ=|cDxlDNhpVtVRi7r9UQWh2Gi\/AQuDLwfS8lDRx0QZmt97x45FfJTfkg==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/cdca7bcb-fac8-30a3-9485-6cd9bc4f15d2\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.958,"name":"Education"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/cdca7bcb-fac8-30a3-9485-6cd9bc4f15d2\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/cdca7bcb-fac8-30a3-9485-6cd9bc4f15d2\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/cdca7bcb-fac8-30a3-9485-6cd9bc4f15d2\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/aca8a560-af35-3623-996b-215434857956","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Susan Herbst","importance":"1","originalValue":"Susan Herbst"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/cdca7bcb-fac8-30a3-9485-6cd9bc4f15d2\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/cdca7bcb-fac8-30a3-9485-6cd9bc4f15d2\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/29c83c39-9d1d-3297-9780-df68a576be14","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Farmington, Connecticut","importance":"1","originalValue":"Farmington, Connecticut"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/cdca7bcb-fac8-30a3-9485-6cd9bc4f15d2\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/cdca7bcb-fac8-30a3-9485-6cd9bc4f15d2\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/6304dd32-9e1f-304b-9520-c27592726450","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"University of Connecticut","importance":"1","originalValue":"University of Connecticut"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/cdca7bcb-fac8-30a3-9485-6cd9bc4f15d2\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/cdca7bcb-fac8-30a3-9485-6cd9bc4f15d2\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/269e15c3-c1f7-3b8e-9703-bcdee01faf01","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Connecticut","importance":"2","originalValue":"Connecticut"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/cdca7bcb-fac8-30a3-9485-6cd9bc4f15d2\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/cdca7bcb-fac8-30a3-9485-6cd9bc4f15d2\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/319dac9e-f5e1-3ee8-90bc-227f07cc45ee","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Education in the United States","importance":"2","originalValue":"Education in the United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/cdca7bcb-fac8-30a3-9485-6cd9bc4f15d2\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Pharmaceuticals -
