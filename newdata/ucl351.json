Last week, they broke an Islamic State siege of the\nprovincial capital, which sits on the western bank of the river.\nThe Deir al-Zor military council, fighting as part of the\nU.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), has meanwhile\nadvanced towards Deir al-Zor from the eastern side of the river\nsince launching an offensive into the province a week ago.\nMilitary council commander Ahmed Abu Khawla warned\ngovernment forces and their militia allies against firing across\nthe river as his fighters close in -- something he said had\nhappened in recent days.\n\"Now we have 3 km between us and the eastern riverbank, once\nour forces reach the area, any shot fired into that area we will\nconsider an attack on the military council,\" he said.\n\"We have notified the regime and Russia that we are coming\nto the Euphrates riverbank, and they can see our forces\nadvancing,\" he said. \"We do not allow the regime or its militias\nto cross to the eastern riverbank.\"\nBut Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova\nsaid the Syrian army had already crossed.\n\"The suburbs of this provincial centre (Deir al-Zor) have\nbeen liberated. Advance units have successfully crossed the\nEuphrates and are holding positions on its eastern bank,\" she\nsaid, without specifying where.\nAbu Khawla said this was \"mere propaganda ... no one has\ncrossed.\"\nAssad aide Bouthaina Shaaban later said the Syrian\ngovernment was ready to fight the SDF.\n\"Whether it's the Syrian Democratic Forces, or Daesh\n(Islamic State) or any illegitimate foreign force in the country\n... we will fight and work against them so our land is freed\ncompletely from any aggressor,\" she said in an interview with\nHezbollah's Al Manar TV.\n\"I'm not saying this will happen tomorrow ... but this is\nthe strategic intent,\" she said, dismissing suggestions that\nWashington and Moscow's military decisions would decide Syria's\nfate.\nThe Russian- and U.S.-backed campaigns against Islamic State\nin Syria have mostly stayed out of each other's way as the sides\nseek to avoid conflict, with the Euphrates often acting as a\ndividing line between the sides. Talks have been underway to\nextend a formal demarcation line that has separated the\ncampaigns, officials have said.\nThe SDF accused Syrian government forces of attacking its\npositions near the town of Tabqa in Raqqa province and the\nUnited States shot down a Syrian government warplane in June.\nAbu Khawla said a civilian administration would be set up to\nrun areas of Deir al-Zor province captured from Islamic State by\nhis fighters, including oil fields. The Syrian government was\n\"not fit to lead and rule the people\", he said.\nOil-rich Deir al-Zor province is Islamic State's last major\nfoothold in Syria and Iraq. It is bisected by the Euphrates\nRiver and abuts Iraq.\n\n\"MOVING FORCEFULLY AND QUICKLY\"\n\"Every village around the eastern riverbank of the Euphrates\nriver until the Iraqi-Syrian border is a goal for our forces,\"\nhe said. \"We are moving forcefully and quickly. We do not have a\ntimeline, but we hope soon to free the entire eastern bank.\"\nReflecting the demarcation line, the U.S.-led coalition said\non Thursday the SDF was not planning to enter Deir al-Zor city.\n\nBut while Deir al-Zor city was not an SDF target, Abu Khawla\ndid not rule out the possibility it may become one, saying\npeople in the city wanted to be liberated from \"the regime and\nDaesh at the same time\".\nBut \"right now, we have a schedule that we’re following\nwhich is the liberation of the eastern riverbanks of the\nEuphrates\", he said.\nHe said Islamic State had \"shown fierce resistance\" when SDF\nfighters entered the outskirts of Deir al-Zor on the eastern\nbank. \"The battles are continuous,\" he said.\nAbu Khawla, who is in his early 30s, said 10,000 fighters\nwere taking part in the Deir al-Zor campaign, the bulk of them\nmembers of Arab tribes from eastern Syria. The campaign is\nsupported by the Kurdish militia that dominate the SDF.\n\"All our soldiers’ training (is) in the Coalition training\ncamps, they oversee our training and our armament,\" he said.\nAbu Khawla was a member of a Free Syrian Army rebel group in\nDeir al-Zor until Islamic State took over most of the province\nin 2014 at the height of its expansion in Syria and Iraq. He\nfled to Turkey before returning to Syria and joining the SDF.\n\"Now we are setting up a civil council parallel to the\nmilitary council of Deir al-Zor, and this civilian council will\nrun all areas freed from (Islamic State),\" he said.\n(Additional reporting by John Davison in Beirut and Christian\nLowe in Moscow, Writing by Tom Perry; editing by Ralph
