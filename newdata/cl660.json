With its mobility being increased, Hwasong-12 poses an imminent threat to the US and its allies in the region,\" he said.\n\nThe North's previous missile launch, a Hwasong-12 IRBM just over two weeks ago, also overflew Japan's main islands and was the first to do so for years.\n\n\"Within three to five years, the North is expected to be capable of operating nuclear missiles as deterrence,\" Yang added.\n\n- Calls for talks -\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron jointly appealed Friday for a resumption of direct talks with North Korea, as the only way out of the crisis.\n\nWhile Russia and China both backed this week's US-drafted sanctions resolution, they have been pushing a proposal to kick-start talks with North Korea with a freeze on the country's nuclear and missile tests in exchange for a suspension of US-South Korea military drills.\n\nBut the United States has rejected the proposal as \"insulting\" and maintains it will only enter into talks with Pyongyang if it halts all missile and nuclear tests unilaterally.\n\nIn response to Friday's launch, South Korea's military immediately carried out a ballistic missile drill of its own, with the defence ministry saying it took place while the North's rocket was still airborne.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-In told an emergency meeting of Seoul's national security council that dialogue with the North was \"impossible in a situation like this\".\n\nBut unless something changes, it is likely the tests will continue, said professor Yang Moo-Jin of the University of North Korean Studies.\n\n\"There is a high possibility that the North may test-fire another ICBM by the end of this year to prove it has mastered the technology,\" he said.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
