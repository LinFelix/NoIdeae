Security Council\nwas due to meet at 3 p.m. ET (1900 GMT) on Friday to discuss the\nmissile launch, at the request of the United States and Japan.\nThe council's 15 members unanimously stepped up sanctions\nagainst North Korea over a nuclear bomb test it staged on Sept.\n3, imposing a ban on North Korea's textile exports and capping\nits imports of crude oil.\nNorth Korea has launched dozens of missiles under leader Kim\nJong Un as it accelerates a weapons programme designed to give\nit the ability to target the United States with a powerful,\nnuclear-tipped missile.\nTillerson said in a speech to foreign officials that the\ntests threaten the world and stressed the United States was\nworking closely with regional allies Japan and South Korea.\n\"In East Asia, an increasingly aggressive and isolated\nregime in North Korea threatens democracies in South Korea,\nJapan, and more importantly, and more recently, has expanded\nthose threats to the United States, endangering the entire\nworld,\" Tillerson said.\nTaking a tougher line than Tillerson, White House National\nSecurity Adviser H.R. McMaster said the United States was fast\nrunning out of patience for diplomatic solutions on North Korea.\n\"We've been kicking the can down the road, and we're out of\nroad,\" McMaster told reporters.\n\"For those ... who have been commenting on a lack of a\nmilitary option, there is a military option,\" he said, adding\nthat it would not be the Trump administration's preferred\nchoice.\nLATEST MISSILE\nNorth Korea's latest test missile flew over Hokkaido in\nnorthern Japan on Friday and landed in the Pacific about 2,000\nkm (1,240 miles) to the east, the Japanese government said.\nIt travelled about 3,700 km (2,300 miles) in total,\naccording to South Korea's military, far enough to reach the\nU.S. Pacific territory of Guam, which the North has threatened\nbefore.\n\"The range of this test was significant since North Korea\ndemonstrated that it could reach Guam with this missile,\" the\nUnion of Concerned Scientists advocacy group said in a\nstatement. However, the accuracy of the missile, still at an\nearly stage of development, was low, it said.\nOn Thursday, Tillerson called on China, Pyongyang's only\nally, and Russia to apply more pressure on North Korea by\n\"taking direct actions of their own.\"\nBut Beijing pushed back.\nForeign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying denied that China\nheld the key to easing tension on the Korean peninsula and said\nthat duty lay with the parties directly involved. She also\nreiterated China's position that sanctions on North Korea are\nonly effective if paired with talks.\nNorth Korea staged its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb\ntest earlier this month and in July tested long-range\nintercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching at least\nparts of the U.S. mainland.\nLast month, North Korea fired an intermediate range missile\nthat also flew over Hokkaido into the ocean.\nWarning announcements about the latest missile blared around\n7 a.m. (2200 GMT Thursday) in parts of northern Japan, while\nmany residents received alerts on their mobile phones or saw\nwarnings on TV telling them to seek refuge.\nThe U.S. military said soon after the launch it had detected\na single intermediate range ballistic missile but it did not\npose a threat to North America or Guam, which lies 3,400 km\n(2,110 miles) from North Korea.\nThe missile reached an altitude of about 770 km (480 miles)\nand flew for about 19 minutes, according to South Korea's\nmilitary.\nOn global markets, shares and other risk assets barely moved\nand gold fell as traders paid little attention to the latest\nmissile test, shifting their focus to where and when interest\nrates will go up.\n\nDIFFERENCES OVER DIRECT TALKS\nU.S. President Donald Trump has promised not to allow North\nKorea to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped\nmissile.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin discussed the launch in a\nphone call with French President Emanuel Macron and agreed on\nthe need for a diplomatic solution, including through resuming\ndirect talks on North Korea.\nAsked about the prospect for direct talks, a White House\nspokesman said, \"As the president and his national security team\nhave repeatedly said, now is not the time to talk to North\nKorea.‚Äù\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in also said dialogue with\nthe North was impossible at this point. He ordered officials to\nanalyse and prepare for possible new North Korean threats,\nincluding electromagnetic pulse and biochemical attacks, a\nspokesman said.\nThe United States and South Korea are technically still at\nwar with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended\nwith a truce and not a peace treaty. The North accuses the\nUnited States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of\nplanning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its\nAsian allies.\nDavid Wright, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the\nlatest test had demonstrated North Korea could reach Guam with a\nHwasong 12 missile, although it was not known what payload the\nmissile was carrying.\nWright said it would be difficult for North Korea to use the\nmissile to destroy Anderson U.S. Air Force Base in Guam given\nwhat is known about its guidance systems, even if the missile\nwas carrying a high-yield warhead.\n(Reporting by Jack Kim and Christine Kim in Seoul and Susan\nHeavey in Washington; Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano,\nWilliam Mallard, Tim Kelly and Chehui Peh in Tokyo, Jeff
