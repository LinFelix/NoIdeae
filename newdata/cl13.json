(http:\/\/on.wsj.com\/2h87WOt)\nThe privately-held toy retailer had previously said it was working with investment bank Lazard Ltd to help address its approximately $5 billion in debt, of which roughly $400 million comes due next year.\nThe potential Chapter 11 filing could be a result of the company's suppliers tightening trade terms, including holding back on shipments unless the toy retailer is able to make cash payments on delivery, the newspaper reported.\nToys 'R' Us declined to comment on the report.\nThe move by Toys \"R\" Us to potentially file for bankruptcy comes at a time when more and more consumers increasingly make purchases from online retailers like Amazon.com Inc &lt;AMZN.O&gt; and avoid visiting brick-and-mortar shops. \nThere have been more than a dozen significant retail bankruptcies this year, but none for retailers as big as Toys \"R\" Us, which has more than 1,600 stores worldwide.\nToys tapped restructuring attorneys from Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP, CNBC reported this month.  \nThe company has been saddled with debt since buyout firms KKR &amp; Co L.P. &lt;KKR.N&gt; and Bain Capital LP, together with real estate investment trust Vornado Realty Trust &lt;VNO.N&gt;, took Toys \"R\" Us private for $6.6 billion in 2005. \n\n\n (Reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; editing by Diane Craft)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
