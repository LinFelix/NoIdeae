He would have been someone's son, he could have been a brother, a father, an uncle or a friend,\"\n\n\"I have no doubt that his family would dearly love to know what has happened to their loved one, and we would like to identify this man and bring some closure for the family.\"\n\nInvestigators have re-released a digital face image and CCTV images of the man, as well as an image of a jacket he was wearing on the night.\n\nThe man is perceived to be of Indian subcontinental appearance, aged between 20 to 30-years-old and approximately 170cm tall.\n\nHe was wearing a sports club jacket, believed to be from New South Wales, with a logo reading \"Valley Statesman Rugby League\".\n\nDetectives have identified the original owner of the jacket, and believe it was discarded either in Pakenham or Doncaster in the months prior to the man's death.\n\nAnyone with any information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
