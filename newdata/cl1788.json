Distillers will open the doors of its new facility on Raasay, with the first batch of Scotch ready to drink in 2020\n\nA TINY SCOTS island is set to welcome its first distillery - with THOUSANDS of tourists set to visit.\n\nR&B Distillers will open the doors of its new facility on Raasay this weekend.\n\nAnd the first batch of Scotch ready to drink in 2020.\n\nBosses are hoping that 12,000 visitors will head to the island for the new brewery.\n\nAnd there's been a welcome job boost for the 120 residents, with a tenth of locals expected to get jobs there.\n\nIt's a dream come true for co-founders Alasdair Day and Bill Dobbie.\n\nAlasdair said: \"I think the fact that it's an island off an island with complex geology, water and island climate that makes Raasay ideal for our innovative Scotch whisky distillery.\n\n\"The water has a high mineral content and probably the best view from any distillery in Scotland.\"\n\nThe distillery, which opens today, is fitted out with two copper pot stills sourced from Frilli in Tuscany.\n\nR&B bosses reckon they'll be able to make 150,000 bottles of whisky a year.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nIt's the first LEGAL distillery in Raasay's history.\n\nBut whisky making, by illicit methods, can date all the way back to the 1800s.\n\nNow the tourism boost is something locals and VisitScotland are looking forward to.\n\nChris Taylor, VisitScotland regional partnership director, told STV: \"The opening of the new Isle of Raasay Distillery is an exciting addition to the tourism offering in the Highlands, particularly with the development of a visitor centre and the promise of such fabulous views from the distillery itself.\n\n\"Whisky is so embedded in the traditions of this country so is seems very fitting that the new distillery is opening during Scotland's Year of History, Heritage and Archaeology.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
