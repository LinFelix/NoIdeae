Sept 15 (Reuters) - Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star\nMovement, which leads most opinion polls ahead of a national\nelection due by May next year, on Friday launched an internal\nballot to choose its leader and candidate for prime minister.\nThe hot favourite is 31-year-old lower house deputy Luigi Di\nMaio, the party's most high-profile and popular politician, who\nhas made no secret of wanting the job and appears to have no\nrivals to worry him.\nThe biggest problem for the maverick movement founded eight\nyears ago may be finding credible alternative candidates in the\ncontest, which will take the form of an online vote of 5-Star's\nmembers, in line with its credo of direct democracy.\nDi Maio, who is deputy speaker of the Chamber of Deputies,\nis considered a good communicator and one of 5-Star's more\nmoderate figures.\nA post on 5-Star's official mouthpiece, the blog of its\nfounder Beppe Grillo, said the candidate for prime minister\nwould also be the party's leader, something which is not always\nthe case in Italian politics.\nGrillo, who founded 5-Star in 2009, has so far acted as its\nde facto chief, though he has never run for any office and the\nparty has always prided itself as having a horizontal structure\nwith no official leader.\nThe only person considered a realistic threat to Di Maio,\nthe fiery deputy Alessandro Di Battista, has given no indication\nthat he plans to run.\nAnother deputy seen as a potential challenger, Roberto Fico,\nwho represents the left wing of the party and has recently\ndistanced himself from Di Maio's tough positions on\nlaw-and-order and immigration, has also not yet made any move.\nThe post on Grillo's blog said 5-Star's local and national\nrepresentatives who wish to run had until Monday to present\ntheir candidacies.\nThe timing of the online vote has not yet been set but the\nwinner is due to be announced on Sept 23 at 5-Star's annual\nnational meeting at the Adriatic coastal town of Rimini.\n(Reporting by Gavin Jones; Editing by Angus MacSwan)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
