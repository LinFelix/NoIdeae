There's partnerships, military-to-military exchanges, that are based on trust and respect.\"\n\"I'm going down to build the trust and show the respect on their Independence Day,\" Mattis said. \nHe stayed above the political fray when asked about the most contentious issues between the two countries. Questioned about his role in the border wall issue, Mattis said there was no U.S. military role in enforcing the borders. \nThe New York Times quoted Trump's chief of staff, John Kelly, suggesting Mexico was on the verge of collapse and comparing it to Venezuela under former President Huge Chavez.\nAsked whether he thought Mexico was on the verge of collapse, Mattis said flatly: \"No.\"\n\"Every nation has its challenges it deals with. And Mexico is keenly aware of these and I'm there to support them in dealing with them,\" Mattis said.\nMattis also said he would also \"absolutely\" express condolences for Mexican victims of a recent earthquake that struck the country, killing 96 people.\nMexico is also hosting Admiral John Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations, the Navy's highest uniformed officer, and General Lori Robinson, the head of U.S. Northern Command, for its Independence Day activities.\nMattis is the first U.S. defense secretary to attend the events. \nAlthough Mexico's official Independence Day is on Sept. 16, most celebrations take place on Sept. 15. The event commemorates the launch of Mexico's war of independence from Spain in 1810.\nThe fact that such senior U.S. military officials would be visiting for such an important national event is itself notable.\nMexicans have a long memory of the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which led to Mexico's loss of almost half its territory to the United States. The war has made U.S.-Mexican military cooperation a somewhat sensitive subject in Mexico.\nIn an apparent nod to Mexican sensitivities, Mattis called the ties between the two militaries \"very strong, quiet.\" \nThere are signs of improving U.S.-Mexican cooperation in cracking down on the heroin trade.\nReuters reported in April that Mexico's army was allowing the United States and the United Nations to observe opium poppy eradication. \nThe Mexican army took U.S. military officials on helicopter tours of half a dozen sites in Sinaloa and Chihuahua, two of the three states that along with Durango make up the Golden Triangle where most Mexican opium is produced, one of the sources said at the time.\n\n (Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 10:35:56.976"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 10:35:56.325","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|jCm+LqkS7gJUUF2U9b4S888kUxc=|B0VH6rIzF4+vy6tFFDGgjM3vm7hHk8oS\/kW1gTdmufe05Ps77tFYiw==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.9,"name":"Politics"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/cat\/2":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.557,"name":"War_Conflict"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/d0345113-3a22-3e5a-aaeb-beecd69a5211","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Western United States","importance":"1","originalValue":"Western United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/72b4f2c4-ec73-3c08-b425-1ffb4426c44d","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"History of the United States","importance":"1","originalValue":"History of the United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/3f9597ab-f266-3e5f-bdfd-7efddabbe428","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Southwestern United States","importance":"1","originalValue":"Southwestern United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/fbb8f3e5-9f07-3f57-b8f2-d792b0f7bc55","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"James Mattis","importance":"2","originalValue":"James Mattis"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/359e9bfd-d04d-3ee5-931a-c69b04eac8d2","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"United States","importance":"2","originalValue":"United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/3e30aa82-5812-3639-ad43-762891af3a64","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Mexico","importance":"2","originalValue":"1848 in Mexico"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/SocialTag\/7":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/028bbd67-ec96-388e-a345-6fd1054cbb4e\/SocialTag\/7","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/a76f950e-56df-316f-9f04-2b2d9823d558","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Presidency of James K.
