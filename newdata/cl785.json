China, along with Britain and France, has announced its intentions to ban petrol and diesel cars starting in 2040. This would bring a huge drop in air pollution in the world's largest car market.\n\nAnd in a speech in Strasbourg on Thursday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker reaffirmed the EU's aim of being \"at the forefront of the fight against climate change.\"\n\nThe US dealt that fight a major setback when Trump pulled the world's biggest economy out of the Paris accord in June.\n\nTo bolster the EU position, Juncker promised to soon put forth a proposal to reduce carbon emissions in the transportation sector.\n\nCatherine McKenna, Canada's environment minister, will meantime press her counterparts and multinationals chief executives to develop solutions for \"a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy.\"\n\nHolding the meeting in Montreal is not coincidence. It is here that negotiations led to the first international agreement on the environment 30 years ago, with a ban on ozone-depleting gases.\n\nIn addition to Canada, the EU countries and China, nations including Russia, India, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey will be represented by senior ministers.\n\nWith only 50 days before the next United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP23), some of the low-lying nations hardest hit by the effects of climate change (the Marshall Islands, Fiji, Maldives) and some of the poorest (Mali and Ethiopia) will also be present.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
