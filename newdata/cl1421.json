We had the Federal Executive Council Meeting on Wednesday that lasted very long beyond the usual.\n\n\"He presided over the Federal Executive Council meeting throughout. He's now firing up and very fantastic,\" Onyeama said.\n\nAccording to him, there is no doubting the fact that the president would make the trip to the U.S. and participate in all the events scheduled for the country.\n\nThe minister stressed: \"He (Buhari) will make the trip; you know the buzz word in the world today is 'fake news'.\n\n\"So I think it's a reality of modern journalism, may be because the internet, the cyber face makes journalist of everybody.\n\n\"So all kinds of news filters through but the reality is that Mr President will be here. He's in excellent health and he's going to be leading a very strong high-level Nigerian delegation.\n\nOnyeama said that aside other high-level engagement, Buhari would meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to further strengthen the bilateral tie between the two countries.\n\nThe Nigerian leader would hold a lunch meeting with Trump along with other world leaders.\n\n\"The relations are good, so we just hope they would continue to be good and by all accounts, we are going in the right direction.\n\n\"What would be discussed are some of the global issues - trade issues with Africa, conflict in Africa, global conflict will also certainly be discussed,\" the minister said.\n\nThe high point of Buhari's activities would be his participation in the General Debate during which he would deliver Nigeria's National Statement on Tuesday, the first day of the general debate.
