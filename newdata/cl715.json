Korea leader says he will complete nuke program\n\nMore: China could pressure North Korea but fears consequences\n\nMore: Haley: North Korea 'begging for war'\n\nHowever, Levy acknowledged earlier generations weren't tuned in to a 24-hour news cycle and always connected on social media, which could be heightening the fear today.\n\nDuring international crises like the one with North Korea, some local millennials say they turn to Twitter's social media platform for updated information -- while some older Americans are reportedly seeking to construct their own bomb shelters.\n\nIn fact, sales have spiked this year, said Ron Hubbard, president of Atlas Survival Shelters,\n\nHis Montebello, California-based business is \"getting hundreds of calls,\" and he said he expects to have a banner year, selling 1,000 shelters at an average price of $25,000 each.\n\n\"We are back in the 1960s again,\" said Hubbard, referring to the Cold War demand for bomb shelters. \"We've got a crazy man on one side and (President) Donald Trump on the other.\"\n\nYork College computer information systems major Andre Johnson said he's not worried about the threat of nuclear war.\n\nThe 22-year-old from Laurel, Maryland, said he consumes his news on Twitter, mostly so he can analyze Trump's reactions.\n\n\"I'm not a huge Trump fan, but I think he's doing the best he can,\" Johnson said. \"But, I mean, it's North Korea. I think they're just talking to try to get a reaction out of us.\"\n\nDr. Allen Miller, of WellSpan Behavioral Health, said the pace of information in the Internet age \"just isn't good.\"\n\n\"Regardless of political spectrum, the possibility of any type of conflict -- whether it be terrorist attack or war between two countries -- is something that people find out about much more quickly,\" he said.\n\nInstead of obsessing over something \"we can't do anything about,\" Miller said people should try both physical and mental activities to help alleviate stress.\n\n\"We need to be actively involved in relationships with other people,\" he said. \"We want to encourage people to do that as opposed to getting caught up in the minute-to-minute news cycle.\"\n\n-- The
