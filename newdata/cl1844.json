During their trip, they will see historical national landmarks. For many, this is not their first time visiting the city but it is for some, the first time they'll be taking the trip with fellow veterans.\n\nOrganizers of the trip say it's important to give this opportunity to those who enlist and risk everything for freedom. John Plaza, Veteran, tells us that it \"helps you remember what you were serving for. Even special more when you go to Washington and get to see our history.\"\n\nJoe Pfadt, President of Warriors to Washington, tells us, \"...we also get to do things that are a little unusual and really mean a lot to us.
