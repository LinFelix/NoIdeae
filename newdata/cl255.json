The opinions expressed here are his own.)\nBy John Lloyd\nSept 15 (Reuters) - Protestors against President Emmanuel\nMacron’s proposed liberalization of French labor laws were on\nthe streets of the country’s cities on Tuesday. The marchers,\nchanting slogans and brandishing placards, halted traffic as\nthey moved slowly through the streets. A fringe of anarchists\nbroke windows; police responded by firing tear gas. But this was\nno rerun of the mass marches of past years, let alone the\nsemi-revolutionary eruptions of 1968.\nFrance’s second-largest union, the Conféderation Générale du\nTravail (CGT) was the only one of the three main workers’\norganizations that took part. Another protest, this one\norganized by the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed)\nparty is scheduled for Sept. 23. The Tuesday marching columns\nnumbered, nationwide, in the few hundred thousand rather than\nthe many millions hoped for – the police claimed 223,000, the\norganizers 400,000. There was little effect on production,\nservices or transportation.\nIt was neither victory nor defeat for either side. Instead,\nMacron’s changes to the vast labor code – hiring and firing will\nbe easier, some workplace issues will be negotiated at company\nlevel – hang in the balance. The CGT, the left and the far-right\nNational Front all oppose them, but Macron and his government\nhave a solid, if inexperienced, majority in the Assembly.\nMore than his predecessors who tried and failed to\nliberalize France’s labor market – the center-right Nicolas\nSarkozy and the center-left Francois Hollande – Macron has\npinned the credibility of his presidency on systemic, cultural\nchange, a deliberate jolting of French society and economy out\nof the rut into which he believes it has fallen. He is\ncontemptuous of both former presidents (he knew Hollande well,\nhaving been both his advisor and Finance Minister), believing\nthem to have given up too soon and too easily. When Macron\nspoke, as he did earlier this month, of “slackers,” he said when\nchallenged that he meant those who retreated from the necessary\nsurgery on France’s body politic. The marchers, however, seized\non the word and put it on their placards: “Macron, the slackers\nwill kick you out,” read one.\nThe slackers have a point. Indeed, they have several. Labor\nproductivity in France is relatively good, only a little behind\nthat of the United States and the highest of Europe’s major\neconomies. When French workers work, they work well.\nThough both Macron’s labor and economic reforms have won\nsupport from the center-right and from many economists, France\nremains doubtful, even hostile. Perhaps the best-known Frenchman\nin political and intellectual circles before Macron was the\neconomist Thomas Piketty, whose “Capital in the 21st Century”\n(2013) is a best seller and who has excoriated his country both\nfor its steeply rising inequality and its hypocrisy in\npretending it is egalitarian. Hypocritical it may be, but it\nclings to the myth, and perfectly bourgeois Frenchmen and -women\nmay recoil from an obvious widening of the income and wealth\ngaps.\nTo put major emphasis on labor reforms may, in any case, not\nbe the main point. Germany liberalized its labor market through\nthe so-called Hartz reforms between 2003 and 2005, but unlike\nFrance the German unions were relatively moderate, wage\nbargaining was already localized and investment was rising. In\naddition, the costs of German unification had already been paid.\nIf France’s CGT and the left and far right cannot mobilize\nenough opposition, the labor reforms will be implemented, and\nthey could be part of a general renaissance of the French\neconomy. That is also dependent on other ifs – if the present\nimprovement in the European Union economy continues (the\nEuropean Commission, while underscoring that all members are\ngrowing, warns of “higher-than-usual uncertainty) and if\ninvestment increases, then France could become more like\nGermany. The German (and EU) leader Chancellor Angela Merkel\nwants to see that, and Macron wishes to show her he can deliver.\nYet delivery of this kind of economy now comes with an\napparently unavoidable cost. Faster growth and even a fall in\nunemployment can produce an ever-larger underclass, composed\nboth of those with few qualifications and the still-increasing\nnumbers of immigrants, often from poor countries. Macron’s\nopponents like to quote the Cambridge University economist\nChristopher Bickerton, who argued in a New York Times column\nthat labor market reforms could generate “new kinds of\ninequality.” Bickerton cited Britain’s deregulated labor market\nas an example, with record employment levels existing alongside\nlow productivity, stagnating wages and a proliferation of\nshort-term contracts. “Not since the economic boom of the 1950s\nand ’60s has capitalism in Europe been dynamic enough to combine\nhigh levels of employment with long-term material gains for the\nmasses,” he wrote. It will not do so, he believes, under Macron.\nThe deeper movement, about which Macron can do little, is\nthat the greater integration into the global economy that he\nchampions produces huge gains for the top one percent, more\nmodest rises for the well educated and skilled, but a much\nlarger tail of the precarious, insecure and low paid. The\nleftist German think tank, the Rosa Luxemburg Institute, called\nthis trend “the end of social capitalism.” A sign of this is the\ngeneral decline of social democratic parties such as the\nonce-mighty German Social Democrats and the shrunken French\nSocialists. Only in the UK has the main left party, Labour, made\nsubstantial political gains with a far-left leadership.\nSocial democracy depended on, and greatly furthered, “social\ncapitalism.” It did so in France, under socialist governments,\ndid so again in Germany and still does, though with difficulty,\nin the Scandinavian states. Organized labor had a place, even an\nhonored and at times powerful one. Now, its gains are a\nhindrance, its ideology no longer attractive. The leaders of the\nfurther left – such as Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn in the UK and\nJean-Luc Melenchon, leader of France Insoumise in France - gain\nby being fundamentalists, opposed to capitalism itself, social\nor not.\nIn moving France towards the globalist model, Macron echoes\nthe claim made nearly four decades ago by British Prime Minister\nMargaret Thatcher, that there is no alternative. In this, he may\nbe more right than she: there is presently no popular base, no\npublic assent, no powerful parties able to show that cooperation\nwith capitalism is best for the workers. And that, sooner or\nlater, will be a large problem – for leftists, or course, for\nthe state which must provide some support for the poor and\nultimately, for the capitalist system itself.\n(Reporting by John Lloyd)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
