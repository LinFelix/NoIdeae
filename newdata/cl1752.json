I could care less about ur fantasy teams. This is my Real Life,\" Beckham tweeted. \"Focusing on getting healthy and gettin better. 1 day at a time.\"\n\nHe means 'could not care less,' but we get the point.\n\nBeckham was limited in practice all week and admitted the injury is a \"six to eight week thing.\"\n\nDespite revealing that timetable, Beckham is trying to get back on the field for Monday night, but head coach Ben McAdoo did not give much to work with on if that will happen.\n\nGreatest win in Giants history is also Tom Brady's worst loss\n\nNo offense. I could care less about ur fantasy teams. This is my Real Life. Focusing on gettin healthy and gettin better. 1 day at a time.ὤfἿd -- Odell Beckham Jr (@OBJ_3)\n\nSeptember 16, 2017\n\n\"We will see how it goes,\" McAdoo said on Saturday. \"We will get in there and do a little bit of work this morning. Then (Sunday) we will go in and have our launch day. Take a look at him (Sunday) and see how it goes.\"\n\nMcAdoo added it will be a medical decision on if he is ready to go, but would not indicate if Beckham needs to be 100% in order to play. He did, however, stress they would use caution.\n\n\"The biggest thing is you don't want to put a player out there that is going to do any harm to himself or injure himself any more than he is,\" McAdoo said. \"It's a tough injury. He's fighting through it and doing everything he can to get back, but we're going to be smart with him.\"\n\nTags: nfl new york giants odell beckham jr. sports injuries fantasy football fantasy sports
