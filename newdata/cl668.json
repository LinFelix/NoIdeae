Nearly eight months later, the group has helped pay for redecorating at the White House and the vice president's residence in Washington.\n\nBut nothing has yet gone to charity.\n\nWhat is left from the massive fundraising is a mystery, clouded by messy and, at times, budget-busting management of a private fund that requires little public disclosure. The Associated Press spoke with eight people -- vendors, donors and Trump associates -- involved in planning and political fundraising for the celebration, an event that provides an early look at the new president's management style and priorities. The people described a chaotic process marked by last-minute decisions, staffing turnover and little financial oversight.\n\nAmong the head-scratching line-items was the pre-inaugural Lincoln Memorial concert, which came with a $25 million price tag, according to four of the people. The concert included the following performances from 3 Doors Down, The Piano Guys, and Toby Keith.\n\nThe price dwarfs a similar event staged eight years earlier for Obama's first inauguration, which included a concert with performances by Bruce Springsteen, Herbie Hancock, Mary J. Blige and Stevie Wonder, among others. One person familiar with the committee's thinking said the $25 million included broadcasting costs and other events, complicating an apples-to-apples comparison with past inaugural concert expenses.\n\nOther people familiar with the committee's activities before and after the inauguration said its efforts were hobbled by a shortage of staff with relevant experience.\n\nTom Barrack, chairman of the private Presidential Inaugural Committee, and other former committee officials said the inauguration was a great success but declined to answer detailed questions from AP about how money was spent. Barrack said that keeping the books closed was no different from any past inauguration.\n\nIn a recent statement, Barrack said the committee's donations to charity \"surely will exceed any previous inauguration,\" but will have to wait until the end of November, when he said the committee will publicly disclose details about its finances.\n\nBarrack told the AP in June that \"a full and clean external audit has been conducted and completed\" of the inaugural committee's finances, though the committee would not share a copy with AP or say who performed it.\n\n\"The thing about inaugural expenses, they're not complicated,\" said Steve Kerrigan, head of President Barack Obama's 2013 inaugural committee. \"You take money in, you pay it out, and then you know what you're left with when it's done.\"\n\nThe committee's total haul of $107 million was nearly twice that of Obama's inauguration in 2009.\n\n\"Our ability to raise more private funding than any inaugural committee before is a tribute to the generosity of the American people and their excitement to \"make America great again,\" Barrack told the AP in a statement this month.\n\n[screen shot: PBS NewsHour]","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 20:07:53.348"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 20:07:52.817","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|TBsJ1RkD5vcbrZDLXW1CDcfHdoU=|AL+SqaLfn1cpljGbyj64G8HkPjmIIwdBYqbYuvZ+jxxnjJL9GlAwxQ==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6e04ba00-edc5-369c-bbe9-ee3d01168d2c\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.758,"name":"Entertainment_Culture"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6e04ba00-edc5-369c-bbe9-ee3d01168d2c\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6e04ba00-edc5-369c-bbe9-ee3d01168d2c\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6e04ba00-edc5-369c-bbe9-ee3d01168d2c\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/0e6ce8a5-a49c-3fc2-b372-fad1e9a2ac36","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"American people of German descent","importance":"1","originalValue":"American people of German descent"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6e04ba00-edc5-369c-bbe9-ee3d01168d2c\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6e04ba00-edc5-369c-bbe9-ee3d01168d2c\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/359e9bfd-d04d-3ee5-931a-c69b04eac8d2","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"United States","importance":"1","originalValue":"United States"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6e04ba00-edc5-369c-bbe9-ee3d01168d2c\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6e04ba00-edc5-369c-bbe9-ee3d01168d2c\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/50214ffb-50ae-357b-8d1d-ae65940a1224","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"January events","importance":"1","originalValue":"January events"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6e04ba00-edc5-369c-bbe9-ee3d01168d2c\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6e04ba00-edc5-369c-bbe9-ee3d01168d2c\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/5ce305cd-14fb-3450-8280-ab4b0bc02911","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"United States presidential inauguration","importance":"2","originalValue":"United States presidential inauguration"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6e04ba00-edc5-369c-bbe9-ee3d01168d2c\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6e04ba00-edc5-369c-bbe9-ee3d01168d2c\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/67379953-4d14-3fbc-8b87-6c23b89a5e5f","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Barack Obama","importance":"2","originalValue":"Barack Obama"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6e04ba00-edc5-369c-bbe9-ee3d01168d2c\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/6e04ba00-edc5-369c-bbe9-ee3d01168d2c\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/6aab5947-37c9-3e0d-a860-928f5bffad59","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Thomas J.
