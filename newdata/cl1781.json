Cutter is being challenged by James Tanhauser Jr. and Trina House LaBonte. The two highest vote-getters will go on to compete for the seat in the Nov. 7 election.\n\nPolls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. All 4,442 registered voters in the ward will cast ballots at the Edward J. Bellamy Middle School on Pendleton Avenue, City Clerk Keith W. Rattell said.\n\n\"These are important races, this is where you get to elect your representative of your ward to represent you in the ward seat on the City Council or the School Committee,\" Rattell said.\n\nPreliminary elections in one ward are common in the city, but high voter turnout is not. Rattell said he hopes 15 percent of the voters, or at least 666 people, cast ballots, but admits that prediction is probably optimistic.\n\nIt costs between $5,000 and $6,000 to operate the election, he said.\n\nCutter has been the Ward 1 School Committee representative for the past four years. He also served on the committee from 2003 to 2007.\n\nA long-term resident of 28 Wilmont St., Cutter, 78, started his career teaching social studies in Athol and spend about 30 years teaching business and distributive education in Chicopee. After he retired, Cutter worked as a substitute teacher mostly in Springfield.\n\nOne of his priorities going forward is to ensure psychological care and health care is available for all students.\n\n\"We have to ensure all students feel comfortable that they can talk about it (personal problems) and the fact is that they don't,\" he said. \"They have to be able to talk to somebody.\"\n\nAlong with his teaching career, Cutter said he has also worked to help raise money and support the Chicopee Boys & Girls Club and helped create a Dress for Success program with his wife Dorothy Cutter.\n\nThe couple have four children and cared for eight foster children over the years.\n\nOne of the biggest debates this year is about the school budget, which was already tight when officials learned at the start of the fiscal year in July there was an about $3.2 million deficit left from the last year that must be made up.\n\n\"If the budget has to be cut we have to determine what will cause the least damage,\" Cutter said.\n\nHis two opponents said their priority will be to balance the budget without taking away programs from students.\n\n\"I believe we need to look at our administration,\" Tanhauser said. \"My main focus is keeping our teachers.\"\n\nTanhauser said he strongly supports merging some city and school departments such as maintenance and human resources, since it should save money. The Edward J. Collins Center of Public Management out of the University of Massachusetts, Boston, is studying the feasibility of combining departments.\n\nHe said eliminating the elementary gifted program, called REACH, should be out of the question, saying he took the class in elementary and middle schools and said he learned valuable lessons when his class debated and researched issues such as climate change, GMOs and learned about current events.\n\nThe School Committee eliminated the elementary program in the budget but later restored it when parents and students protested.\n\n\"The budget is going to be a major issue that needs to be addressed,\" House LaBonte said. \"I think there are ways to work the budget without penalizing students.\"\n\nDuring the debate about restoring the gifted program, one School Committee member asked if the about $80,000 needed for the program could be taken from the athletic budget. House LaBonte said she does not feel one group of students should have to give up something for another group.\n\nShe said it is time to look at contract with Kelly Service, the outside employment agency which hires substitute teachers. No other school department in the region hires a private company and House LaBonte, who has worked as a substitute in Westfield, said she believes the school department could do the same work in-house at a lower cost.\n\nHouse LaBonte, 47, of 53 Cross St., holds a liberal arts degree from Springfield Technical Community College and has some credits towards a bachelor's degree. She is a paraprofessional in Westfield Schools, working as a one-on-one assistant to a student with autism. The last two years she has worked as a substitute teacher in Westfield and previously spent 20 years as a manager of a group home for disabled adults.\n\nHouse LaBonte has been a school volunteer since her 15-year-old son, entered school, first as a leader of the Parent Teacher Organization at Lambert-Lavoie School and now as the vice president of the Comprehensive High School Football Booster Club. She is also a volunteer with the Boy Scout Troop 1849.\n\n\"I think being a mom it gives me experience that others don't have,\" she said. \"I'm not a politician. I don't want to be a politician. I Just want to do what is right for the kids.\"\n\nIf elected House LaBonte said she will lead by an example outgoing School Committee member Sharon Nawrocki set. She said Nawrocki is always approachable, a great resource, and is happy to help handle any problem, no matter how small it seemed.\n\nTanhauser, 22, who graduated this spring from Western New England University with a bachelor's degree in history and political science, said his age is an advantage.\n\n\"Since I was in school so recently, I feel my perspective is more in touch with how students see the world and how they use information they learn,\" he said.\n\nTanhauser, of Pondview Drive, is an assistant boys' soccer coach at his alma mater Comprehensive High School and works at Price Rite. He is also a member of the city's Historical Commission.\n\nIf elected to the School Committee, he said he would like to focus on upgrading technology at all the schools.\n\n\"I want to continue to look at new ways to modernize our technology to stay ahead of the game,\" he said. \"We can't afford to be in deficit, we need to continually upgrade and improve.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
