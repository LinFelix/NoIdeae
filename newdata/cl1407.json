(National Hurricane Center)\n\nHurricane Jose continues to meander off the Southeast U.S. coast. It is now located about 500 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. After briefly weakening to a tropical storm on Thursday, Jose was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane last night. Its maximum sustained winds are now 80 mph.\n\nA sprawling high pressure system over the central Atlantic ocean is \"trapping\" Jose, or preventing it from heading out to sea. At least so far.\n\nUnder weak upper-level winds, Jose has made limited forward progress over the past week. However, over the next few days, the western edge of the high pressure system that is trapping Jose will being to weaken. This should create a path for escape into the North Atlantic.\n\nThe consensus track from the latest weather model updates now keeps Jose well off the Mid-Atlantic coast, with the storm likely to make its closest pass to the D.C. region on Tuesday. At that point, Jose should be some 100 or more east of Delaware. Farther north, the storm comes closer to land.\n\nGFS ensemble members keep Jose offshore and moving due north towards New England. (University of Albany)\n\nIt is still worth monitoring Jose because a slight change in track to the west or east could meaningfully alter the forecast. As it appears now, Jose's Mid-Atlantic impacts will mostly be limited to large ocean swells into early week.\n\nFolks on Long Island and across coastal New England should keep increased attention to Jose, as the storm's northward movement will track it close to that region during the coming week. It is unclear what the intensity of Jose will be at that point -- it may even be acting somewhat like a winter-time nor'easter by then. Regardless, the likelihood of impacts such as strong winds and at least minor storm surge is heightened there.\n\nNo rest for the weary\n\nThe Atlantic remains extremely active. Tropical Storm Lee was named this morning off the Africa Coast, to the west of the Cabo Verde Islands.\n\nOut ahead of Lee, a potentially more ominous low pressure disturbance is gathering steam. Likely to be christened Maria in the near future, this area of organized convection is showing signs of intensification. It is presently tracking due east toward the Lesser Antilles.\n\nGFS model tracks bring another strong hurricane right over the Caribbean islands again by next week. (NCAR)\n\nUnfortunately, favorable conditions similar to those that allowed Irma to intensify and track through parts of the island chain are still more or less in place. Current model projections are certainly concerning for a region still reeling. The National Hurricane Center is forecasting a hurricane in the days ahead, and it is possible some places could take a second direct hit from a major hurricane over the coming week.\n\nFarther down the line, if it survives its trek near or through the islands, the United States may have to watch this one as well.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
