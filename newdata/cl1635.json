It's the thin-skinned liberals who worry me.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nAs a young conservative, Zack Chambers has learned a valuable life lesson on Indiana University's far left Bloomington campus.\n\nPick your shots.\n\n\"You have to choose which hill to fight on,\" the 2015 Westfield High graduate said.\n\nSo one day, when an English professor called out students in class for not being more active in liberal causes, Chambers had to decide whether to challenge the instructor's assumptions. He chose, probably wisely, to stay quiet.\n\nMore: Trump, Pelosi and Schumer: Bipartisanship is back at the White House\n\nMore: For ESPN and Jemele Hill, mixing politics and sports is bad business\n\n\"You have professors here or there who are hostile to your world view. Some professors will go out of their way to insult conservatives and Republicans. That's their right; the classroom is not a democracy,\" Chambers said. \"You just try to get through it, and you hope it won't have an effect on grades.\"\n\nStill, Chambers, a junior in the Kelley School of Business, hasn't put his beliefs on a shelf while at IU.\n\nHe's the press secretary for the College Republicans. And he wrote columns for the Daily Student for three semesters, championing conservative ideas and challenging liberal orthodoxy.\n\nHis writing was occasionally blunt.\n\nA few days after Donald Trump was elected president, Chambers wrote a column for the student newspaper under the headline, \"Make IU Great Again.\"\n\nIt began this way: \"You win some, you lose some. Republicans learned this lesson in 2008 and 2012 when President Obama was handed the reins of power. However, it has become apparent that the masses of coddled, participation trophy hoarders on campus have yet to comprehend this themselves. Last Tuesday has led to what is perhaps the biggest public meltdown IU will ever experience. Classes were cancelled, safe spaces were established, tearful rallies occurred -- this is not how functional adults deal with disappointment and defeat.\"\n\nWhoa, Zack, How did the \"participation trophy hoarders\" respond?\n\n\"You do get angry emails, but most students are apolitical,\" he said. \"Eighty percent of them are here to get an education and to go to Kilroy's at the end of the week.\"\n\nChambers' concerns about liberal bias in the classroom are well founded. About 60 percent of the nation's professors identify as \"liberal\" or \"far left,\" according to the Higher Education Research Instituteat UCLA. Progressives outnumber conservatives about five to one in college classrooms.\n\nMore: Why are Christian pastors endorsing Trump's North Korea war threat?\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nAnd while many academics insist that their biases aren't a burden to their students, that's inconsistent with a value almost all universities trumpet: the need to promote diversity.\n\nOne of the great benefits of surrounding yourself with a diverse group of people is the varied viewpoints and life experiences they bring to addressing challenges. We really can learn from and learn to appreciate each other because, not in spite, of our differences.\n\nBut far too often on college campuses (and, to be fair, in many newsrooms) ideological diversity is as welcome as a \"Go Boilermakers!\" chant in Assembly Hall. In that environment, conservatives learn, just like Zack Chambers, to pick their shots. Or otherwise be prepared to live with constant conflict.\n\nStill, I don't feel too bad for Zack and his small band of conservative friends in Bloomington. They already know that the world doesn't owe them a safe space.\n\nNo, I feel much worse for their liberal peers, who one day will venture from the campus cocoon with hard lessons still unlearned.\n\nTim Swarens writes for The Indianapolis Star, where this piece first appeared.
