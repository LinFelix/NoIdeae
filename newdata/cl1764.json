When he asked to rejoin the team as a senior, he was welcomed back with open arms.\n\n\"I missed football enough I had to get one more year,\" Hagel said.\n\nHagel relishes the fact he got the opportunity to play both sports while at Ripon, even if football was just for two years.\n\n\"It's great to do that at the collegiate level for a strong athletic program like Ripon,\" Hagel said.\n\nLooking back, Hagel knows the choice to temporarily give up football was a tough decision but was ultimately the correct one.\n\n\"Over the years it would have been nice to have a full career at Ripon for both sports but it was the right choice,\" Hagel said.\n\nWhile it might be tempting to say a collegiate hall of fame career is what was most memorable, Hagel's time on the Ripon baseball team gave him something even more special -- friendships.\n\n\"A lot of guys who were on the team with me are my best friends,\" Hagel said. \"We've stood up in each others weddings, still play poker and fantasy baseball together.\"\n\nDespite his competitive nature, those connections are what Hagel cherishes most when reflecting on his athletic career.\n\n\"All my best friends come from relationships on the sports field one way or another,\" Hagel said. \"Sports is where it began.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
