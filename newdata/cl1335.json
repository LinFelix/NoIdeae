The phrase was rolled out with the original Pixel to refer to the fact it was the first time Google created both the software and hardware of a smartphone.\n\nThe Google event will come shortly after Apple begins shipping new iPhone 8 models unveiled this week at an event at the company's new \"spaceship\" campus in Silicon Valley.\n\nApple also announced a 10th anniversary iPhone X, touting the new flagship device as the next generation of mobile computing.\n\nThe Apple handset starting US$999 (RM4,185) will be available starting Nov 3 in more than 50 markets.\n\nSamsung last month unveiled a new model of its Galaxy Note with a similarly high price tag as it seeks to mount a renewed challenge to iPhones.\n\nPricing on a Pixel 2 remained to be seen, but the original handset competes in the premium segment of the market. -- AFP","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
