Catrinka partners with women artisans in Mexico and India to make gorgeous traditional textiles that are used in modern bags and accessories. The products are sold by a network of female brand ambassadors who can make some extra income for themselves while also supporting a great mission, and part of the proceeds are used to fund the Catrinka Girls Project, a life-skills mentorship class for young Mayan girls living in Guatemala. Empowerment isn't just a slogan, it's baked into every part of the company.\n\nCatrinka was founded by Megan Reilly Cayten, a Brooklyn mom whose previous life was in international development. She worked on projects to build power plants, remodel airports, finance wastewater facilities -- glamorous stuff like that. \"It's not very sexy to most people, she says, \"But I find that what motivates me most in life is creating choices for those who did not have them before. I was raised with every possible choice, but that's not the case for most people in the world. I'm motivated by making it possible for them to not spend all day carrying water on their head or sitting in the dark at night so they can follow their dreams.\"\n\nShe started the company in 2013, when she took some time off from work to spend with her kids and wanted to take on a side project that would empower women and girls. She thought it would just be a temporary gig, but at the end of the year she realized she'd built enviable partnerships with female artisans and actually had a business model that worked. Plus, by the end of 2013 Catrinka had created more than 1,500 days of work for women, and more than 47,000 days of education for girls. How could she give that up?\n\nTo date, Catrinka has provided work for more than 250 women in 16 countries, and supported 440 girls in 5 countries. Its work centers around indigenous Mayan women in Central America, a group that has been discriminated against for centuries.\n\nBy hiring female artisans to create traditional textiles, the company is helping to preserve a central part of the women's culture. Cayten's design challenge has been updating these textiles for the modern woman -- which she does by using sophisticated color palettes and leather -- while still respecting the centuries of tradition behind each piece of fabric. \"I have a friend who says language is culture made audible and textiles are culture made visible,\" Cayten says. \"And I think it's true. These textiles are this amazing representation of who these women are.\"\n\nEvery Catrinka product is named after a woman whose handiwork helps create it. So if you buy the Maria Elena Clutch you know that the textile you're carrying was woven by Maria Elena, a mother of four from Chiapas, Mexico, who started weaving when she was 12. If you buy the Ceci Tote you know your bag was woven by Josefa, whose 16-year-old daughter Ceci had to drop out of school because her family didn't have enough money to continue. Catrinka's goal is to give Ceci's mom enough work that she can earn the money she needs to send Ceci back to school.\n\nAnd here's the thing about investing in women and girls: It pays dividends. Research has shown that when women are able to work and earn money, they invest way more of that money back into their families than men do. That means that as women become breadwinners, their children eat better, become healthier, and get better educations. There's a ripple affect that affects the entire community. And educating girls is one of the most efficient ways to reduce suffering around the world, because it's the most effective way to break the cycle of poverty.\n\nIf you're looking for other ways to make an impact when you shop, there are resources to help. Global Goods Partners offers a curated collection of fair trade partners that together employ more than 3,000 women around the world. The Good Guide lets you scan a barcode and get information on whether the product was made in an ethical, eco-friendly way. Also, let's not forget that the most effective way to make the world better is to force institutions to change, so consider donating to politicians or organizations that support manufacturing policies you agree with.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
