I'm not a marketing expert but I know it wouldn't look right.\n\nBut are you a chef?\n\nAbsolutely. When I left Sarah Metcalfe School, I wanted to join the Royal Navy but I failed the medical through a perforated eardrum. I eventually got a job behind the bar at the Dog and Gun in Potto, ended up as carvery chef and it went from there.\n\nIt's a long way from a pub carvery to your own company, though...\n\nAfter the Dog and Gun, I was one of three chefs in Martha's Vineyard at The Kirk, then I went offshore as a catering steward before coming home for a spell at the Blue Bell in Acklam and eight years in hotel services and hospitality at James Cook Hospital. Then, after working at Wetherspoons for a while, I started doing Christmas lunches at the Beechwood and Easterside Club and took over the snack bar on the corner. I set up my own catering company and it was during that time I developed my own parmo.\n\nWhat gave you the idea for the parmo ready meal?\n\nA lot of the lads at the club would say \"I got too drunk last night and couldn't finish my parmo\" so I thought \"why not have it in the fridge so you can eat it when you want?\" I knew \"cook-chill-reheat\" systems from my work at the hospital and within a couple of weeks of having the idea, I was making them.\n\nWho was your first customer?\n\nCostCutters on Fabian Road in Eston. I'd take 30 to 40 a week there - and they still stock them! We had to put them into some stores, little independents, to see if they would sell. I'd put them into paper shops if they had a fridge that sold ready meals.\n\nIt had a different name to start with, didn't it?\n\nWe originally called them parmesans, but it was about the time there was a bit of fuss from Italy because they didn't have parmesan cheese in them. I changed it to \"parmos\" because that's what people shorten it to anyway and I didn't want any chew further down the line.\n\nWhen did you move in at Skippers Lane?\n\nWe moved in about 11 years ago although it took a year to get the licences and everything in place. We have 20 staff now and start work at 6am.\n\nWhat chicken do you use?\n\nIt's always fresh chicken breast. It used to be only British chicken but it got so expensive, the wholesaler imports it from Europe too. And it has to be fresh - you can't use frozen because its structure and texture changes and you can't flatten it properly. We use anywhere between 2.5-3 tonnes a week.\n\nWhat's the process?\n\nOur butchers take the raw chicken breasts and trim them to make sure there are no bones. Then they flatten them with a baton or a rolling pin before coating them in a batter adhesive and rolling it in breadcrumbs. Then the baker bakes it in the oven in a lightly oiled tray - we can get 108 large ones or 180 minis in the oven at the same time. Once baked, they go through a blast chiller, which brings them down to below 5C within 45 minutes - it's all about minimising the risk of contamination by ensuring they aren't at a temperature where bacteria can multiply.\n\nIt's all about the 'bech' (and cheese)\n\nWe make about 100 litres of bechamel at a time, which will do about 1,200 parmos in 10 batches a week. We make it on site with a mix of milk, butter, seasoning and thickening agent - and it has to be cooled before it goes on the chicken. Our cheese is coloured cheddar - we get through about 400 kilos a week. Then the finished, cooled parmo goes in an ovenable tray, cellophane put on top and that's it. They have an eight day shelf life from production although we've had it tested for 10 days and it came back as safe to eat. We have to be tested twice a year to make sure everything is working well.\n\nWhere does it go when it leaves Skippers Lane?\n\nAsda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, the Co-op, some independents - around 100 stores in total. But we stock three times more with Asda - they've been there from the start. Geographically, we concentrate on Teesside obviously but I know Sainsbury's in Scarborough stocks them, for example.\n\nAnd what are the figures?\n\nWe make about 10,000 parmos a week, with weekly sales of around £18,000. Of those, about 4,000 are large chicken parmos, 4,000 mini chicken, 1,000 hotshots, which we only launched last year, 500 pork and a few hundred pies. But the margins are tight, especially when the cost of materials like chicken goes up - we're lucky to make 10p to 15p per parmo, but we're high on numbers. The Brexit factor is a worry though - I'm spending around £1,200 more a week on chicken and £500 more on cheese than six months ago and it makes a big difference because we use such large quantities.\n\nAny new developments coming up?\n\nAsda South Bank tried some parmo pizzas in a promotion recently and they did well - I think they sold 300 that weekend - so we've sampled and tested them. The main thing we're struggling with is getting the costings right. We're about to launch garlic and chili sauces which you'll be able to order through our new website. And from Monday, about 20 Asda stores will be stocking our parmo pies.\n\nBut would you order a parmo on a night out?\n\nDefinitely! Sometimes I'll order something different but I do like a parmo - and my partner Andrea always has one! She never finishes it though so I can have some of hers. But I wouldn't judge other chefs' parmos - I'm not critical, each to their own. Keep it simple, though - that's the key.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
