It includes a field for soccer, rugby, lacrosse, flag football and softball; a building for bathrooms and storage; and a warm-up field.\n\nTouted by officials as one-of-a-kind facility, it's also the first of its kind on a UW System campus. The project was spurred by an increase in the number of students who participated in intramural sports the past few years.\n\nNathan Scott, director student recreation at UW Oshkosh, said the facility will help expand program offerings to meet the demand.\n\n\"The exciting thing is to see something that was developed by student leadership in 2012 finally come to fruition,\" he said. \"It's going to be available for our current students this spring semester and offer them so many great opportunities.\"\n\nRELATED: UW-Oshkosh Rec Plex project finally goes to bid\n\nRELATED: Two buildings progress, one lags, at UWO\n\nThe 4.35-acre facility, located at Pearl Avenue and Osceola Street, will be used for intramural sports, sports clubs and athletic teams practices and competitions, as well as for informal recreational activities.\n\nNo taxpayer dollars will be used for the $6.4 million project. It's funded by student segregated fees and surplus funds from the 2007 construction of the Student Recreation and Wellness Center. Students in 2011 voted to increase their segregated fees by $5 to fund the Rec Plex.\n\nIt was originally scheduled for 2013 but faced a number of obstacles that hindered its progress. The Rec Plex is slated for completion in March.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http:\/\/oshko.sh\/2y4sg9Y","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
