[Consilium]\n\nA majority of member states agreed to start preparing a new levy on digital companies to compensate for low-tax regimes that cost billions of euros to European governments.\n\nThe European Commission will put forward a set of options this month to solve the issue, which is complex because of internet companies' different business models and opposition from several member states.\n\nA few critics of the new tax proposal, including the UK, warned during discussions Saturday (16 September) in the Ecofin Council in Tallinn (Estonia) that the plan could be seen as an attack against US companies.\n\nDespite some \"diverging opinions\", the economics and finance ministers concluded that \"we need to move together\" to address the beneficial tax situation of Google, Amazon, Facebook and other companies, said Estonian Finance Minister Toomas Toniste.\n\n\"Everyone agrees that the problem exists,\" he told reporters after the Council meeting.\n\nFrench Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, the main driving force behind the initiative, said that Europe \"cannot be kicked around\".\n\nHe admitted that the plan was \"extremely complicated\", but he expressed his satisfaction after the meeting as the ministers widely agreed that there should be EU-level action.\n\nToniste said that a majority of ministers supported a long-term solution to address low taxation rates that these digital firms face on their turnover.\n\nOne of the options is Estonia's proposal to modify the concept of permanent establishment upon which tax regimes are based.\n\nUnder Estonia's approach, a company with significant digital presence, regardless of its physical location, would be deemed to have a \"virtual permanent establishment\" in that jurisdiction, and would be liable to comply with its corporate tax regulations.\n\nThis long-term option would align with the ongoing work at the OECD-level (base erosion and profit shifting-BEPS) and could help Europeans to take the lead on corporate tax policy.\n\nQuick fix\n\nBut as the Estonian presidency of the EU, France and the Commission agreed, there is currently a \"window of opportunity\" to move ahead faster.\n\n\"Time is running out,\" said Dmitri Jegorov, Estonian deputy secretary-general for tax and customs policy. In his opinion, if small and medium-sized companies are encouraged to pay taxes, there is no reason to wait for big digital firms.\n\nMore than a third of member states are in favour of adopting a \"quick fix\" to close loopholes and address the schemes that \"tech giants\" exploit to avoid their tax obligations.\n\nOne of the quick fix options is the proposal that France, Germany, Italy and Spain put forward last week for a so-called \"equalisation tax\" on turnover generated in Europe by digital companies.\n\n\"The amount raised would aim to reflect some of what these companies should be paying in terms of corporate tax,\" said a political statement co-signed by these four countries Saturday. Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Portugal, Romania and Slovenia also supported the statement.\n\nJegorov explained that these countries are \"ready to abandon\" this quick fix when it is no longer needed if there is a more permanent solution, either at European or international level. They committed not to derail parallel efforts to address tax erosion at through the EU Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base or the OECD, he said.\n\nBoth the long-term proposal and the equalisation tax still face an uphill battle.\n\nAs any other tax-related proposal, it could be vetoed by a single country in the 28-member bloc. At least seven countries were sceptical of the idea, including Ireland, Luxembourg, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Denmark, Czech Republic and the UK.\n\nBut despite doubts several countries raised during the meeting, proponents of the idea remained optimistic.\n\nOptimism\n\n\"I am convinced that the countries that could be initially cautious on this would end up accepting the proposal. At the end we will have an agreement at the 28 partners level,\" Spain's Economic Affairs Minister Luis de Guindos said.\n\nBackers of the plan ruled out at this stage using the enhanced cooperation option, which would allow them to proceed with support from at least nine member states.\n\nThe Commission also supported an agreement between all 28 member states. Without full support, the integrity of the internal market could be affected and \"it would make more difficult the ambition of setting up a digital single market,\" Vice-President for Financial Services Valdis Dombrovskis said.\n\nFollowing the ministers' initial political push, the Commission will assess this month what tax challenges digital giants create and what solutions could be offered based on their business models.\n\nThe communication will be a \"scoping exercise\" but will not indicate the Commission's preferred option while political and technical discussions are still ongoing, EU officials said.\n\nEU leaders will have a first look at these options when they meet at the digital summit in Tallinn on 29 September. Over the following weeks, national experts will assess the different options and detail what the capitals will request from the Commission later this year.\n\nMinisters are expected to ask the Commission for a legislative proposal at the Ecofin Council meeting in December. Dombrovskis said that the Commission could present its draft proposal for the new tax on internet giants in spring 2018.\n\nThis would only be the beginning of a difficult legislative process. Supporters of the new tax will find it difficult to gather the required unanimity in the Council. In addition, intense lobbying from tech companies could water down the draft text in the European Parliament.\n\nPractically all companies that would be affected are US-based firms, so the move could further escalate tensions between Washington and European partners.\n\nRelations between the two sides of the Atlantic worsened following Donald Trump's electoral victory in January and his criticism of some European countries' trade policies, including Germany's.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
