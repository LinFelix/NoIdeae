Yesterday the last couple holes we felt like we were playing in a hurricane,\" said Korda.\n\"This golf course is not something that you want to come in with a low ball flight. You need to be able to hit it high to stop them in the right areas and so obviously today that was possible and yesterday was a bit tough.\"\nDefending champion Chun In-gee was seven shots back after mixing four birdies with three bogeys for a one-under-par 70.
