They're either complete arseholes, taking sadistic joy in seeing you run around the concrete yard in your gym knickers in December, or they just don't care because often, they're history teachers who've been roped in at the last minute.\n\nTreating insomnia might be the key to managing conditions like depression and anxiety\n\nThey don't give two sh*ts if you want to take part or not, but if you do want to, they often make it as soul destroying as possible.\n\nBut occasionally, you get a gym teacher who comes along and changes your life.\n\nOne who makes you look at your body in a completely different way and who inspires you to stay fit for life.\n\nAfter years of PE teachers who often turned up to the lesson after a cheeky fag behind the canteen, I got one of those gems.\n\nI went to Catholic all-girls school, run almost entirely by women - many of whom had also gone to that school. And it was great at most things - except sport.\n\nIf you were good at netball then that was you sorted for the next seven years.\n\nIf not, they didn't really care. You could easily get out of PE, siting a continual period, cramps, forgotten kit or mysterious orthodontic advice (balls hitting braces = expensive repairs, amirite?).\n\nThat was until Ms Bloomfield turned up.\n\nShe was a young Olympic hopeful, moonlighting as a PE teacher in between trials for the Commonwealth Games.\n\nAnd although she was only at the school for a term or so, she revolutionised the way I saw my body and what it could do.\n\nI was crap at ball sports but relatively good at swimming and athletics and for the first time at school, she got that.\n\nI didn't need to waste my time gossiping with the goal keeper as a crap wing defense. She got me to use my PE lessons for my own training - doing interval training - eventually pushing me to start competing in the 1500m.\n\nAs for the general attitude towards movement, she called out the period shaming that the school had fostered.\n\n'Having a period is not an excuse not to exercise,' was one of the first things I remember her yelling in the gym to a group of sulky girls.\n\nShe promptly sent those who said they couldn't join in because they were riding the crimson wave to get back in the changing room to get into their kits.\n\n'Unless you're in a lot of pain, use your period to your advantage.'\n\nNow, it's worth saying that for some women, it's physically impossible to get out of bed during their periods - let alone go for a run.\n\nBut the majority of those in my class were simply embarrassed about getting in to their gym knickers or netball skirts while wearing sanitary towels, or they just didn't like doing PE.\n\nI remember Ms Bloomfield explaining sometimes being on your period can give you a surge of energy - and that cramps can be alleviated by gentle exercise.\n\nNormal, every day flow menstruation, wasn't an excuse to stop moving.\n\nTo this day, I make a bigger effort to exercise when I'm on - just in case.\n\nBut it wasn't just period confidence that Ms Bloomfield installed.\n\nFor her, strength was more important than goals.\n\nFor Ms Bloomfield, unlike any other PE teacher or any other woman in that school, had muscles. Serious muscles.\n\nShe was probably the strongest woman I'd ever met - and she was damned fast with it.\n\nAt 15 or 16, you're often stuck in a war against yourself. You're spotty. You're moody. And, for the first time, you're hyper aware of how your body looks.\n\nIt was around that time I started detoxing. I'd drink Epsom Salts every weekend (BAD IDEA) and sup detox teas in a bid to get rid of all the 'impurities' and fat. I'd eat dozens of packets of chewing gum and banana chips as alternatives to genuine food (which, in case you're wondering, just makes you shit yourself. A lot.)\n\nBut it's fair to say that being trained by this absolute machine of a woman helped to realign what I thought was the ideal body shape.\n\nI was never going to be Kate Moss but I could - with a lot of work - aspire to being a Bloomfield #2.\n\nI should point out that she wasn't a popular character. In fact, she probably went down as the most hated PE teacher in our year. But she started a revolution among us; without her, some of us would never have been pushed to get moving or to find the sport that actually spoke to us.\n\nNot everyone wants to play team sports, not everyone has the hand-eye coordination for hockey, football, netball.\n\nIt takes someone who knows about the alternative to push kids into them.\n\nShe allowed me to stop playing netball and to concentrate on athletics, acknowledging that there was no use flogging a dead horse.\n\nShe ran an athletics club after school where for the first time, I got to see what my body could actually do when it was given a proper challenge.\n\nI spent my PE lessons running. I spent my hours before school running. I spent my hours after school running.\n\nAnd here I am, 10 years on - still running.\n\nI've run a marathon. I'm about to run a half marathon. I'm going to be doing my first triathlon in November.\n\nMy group of 11 school friends has all competed in charity runs, some have also done marathons and others have completed mad endurance feats like climbing Kilimanjaro.\n\nAnd I'd say that it's in some part down to a PE temp who taught us that there's more to exercise than netball - and there's more to being a woman than being waif-like.\n\nShe may not have made it as a professional athlete but she certainly changed one class of girls' body image outlooks for the better.\n\nMORE: Fitness blogger's 'Insta Girl Edit' proves that you can't tell what's been edited or not anymore\n\nMORE: Definitive proof that 'fitness models' can be any shape or size\n\nThe Fix The daily lifestyle email from Metro.co.uk.
