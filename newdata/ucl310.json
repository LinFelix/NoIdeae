A third source confirmed she was being considered.\nThe sources spoke on condition of anonymity.\nCongress, controlled by a party led by right-wing defeated\npresidential candidate Keiko Fujimori, voted 77-22 to dismiss\nthe Cabinet in the early hours of Friday, plunging the\ncopper-producing country into its worst political crisis in\nyears.\nThe political turmoil threatens to stall Peru's incipient\neconomic recovery in a worst-case scenario, Central Bank Chief\nJulio Velarde said. He made a rare plea for politicians to avoid\nfanning political tensions after presenting a quarterly report.\nAside from a 0.3 percent depreciation of the local sol\ncurrency early on Friday, Velarde said he did not see major\nimpacts on markets, however.\nAfter the vote, Kuczynski had 72 hours to swear in a new\nCabinet. He can legally reappoint members of his Cabinet except\nfor his prime minister, Fernando Zavala, who has been doubling\nas finance minister since Congress ousted his former finance\nminister in June.\nZavala is not expected to be renamed finance minister.\nDespite the sparring in the legislative branch, Kuczynski, a\nformer investment banker, and Fujimori, the daughter of former\nautocratic President Alberto Fujimori, broadly share the same\nfree-market economic ideology. They clash on social issues,\nhowever, and the conservative populist Fujimori lost the\npresidency to Kuczynski by a razor-thin margin last year.\nIn a plenary debate that stretched on for more than seven\nhours, her allies portrayed Kuczynski, 78, as an out-of-touch\nlobbyist who lacks authority and poses a danger to Peru.\nKuczynski has sought to modernize Peru and give the Andean\ncountry a leadership role in Latin America on issues such as the\nVenezuelan crisis.\n(Writing by Mitra Taj and Caroline Stauffer; editing by Diane\nCraft and Jonathan Oatis)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
