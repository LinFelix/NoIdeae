They remembered how they were taken in. Many people know what it is like to be a refugee,\" said the high commissioner.\n\nShe said the UK was not just active on the humanitarian ground. As the member of Security Council and friend of Bangladesh, they have been clear to say that people responsible for violence, the security forces of Myanmar, must stop it.\n\nIn reply to a question, Blake declined to speculate the consequences of the Security Council statement, but she said the Security Council \"unanimously\" sent a \"powerful message\".\n\n\"If you are able to tell a country to stop it and they stop it, the world would be a very different place,\" Blake said, adding, \"There's patient and quiet diplomacy which is often important for that.\"\n\nOn Friday, Britain released an additional £25 million to deal with what it called the \"unprecedented scale of the crisis in Bangladesh and Burma.\"\n\nUK's International Development Secretary Priti Patel said a majority of the latest funding will be spent in Bangladesh.\n\nUN Migration Agency, IOM, is also seeking a coordinated humanitarian response to the massive inflow of Rohingyas arriving in Cox's Bazar.\n\n\"A visit to the area this week by a UNHCR team, led by Assistant High Commissioner for Operations George Okoth-Obbo, found people suffering real hardship and some of the most difficult conditions seen in any current refugee situation,\" said UNHCR spokesperson Andrej Mahecic in Geneva on Friday.\n\nAn estimated 4,09,000 Rohingyas have arrived in Bangladesh until Friday, escaping the latest military crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine State, says a UN report.\n\nOf them, 22,900 Rohingyas are living in new makeshift settlements in Ukhia and Kutupalong, while 1,59,000 are living in makeshift camps set up by the Rohingyas prior to the influx that began on August 25.\n\nOn the other hand, 21,000 Rohingyas are living with the local host communities, but they are moving to other sites, said the report prepared and updated by Inter Sector Coordination Group led by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).\n\nChallenges, however, are the greatest for children. According to the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), there are at least 2,40,000 children among the refugees, including about 36,000 who are less than a year old. There were also 52,000 pregnant and lactating women, the UN said.\n\n\"Conditions are ripe for the spread of disease,\" Marixie Mercado, a UNICEF spokesperson highlighted at the briefing, noting that refugees also lack drinking water.\n\n\"International response has so far been woefully inadequate, she said, adding, \"Far, far more is needed, not only in funding but also in terms of hands on the ground to help scale up this relief operation.\n\n\"The needs are seemingly endless and suffering is deepening.\"\n\nTo help cope with this situation, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is stepping up its efforts, and starting on Saturday, will launch a polio and measles vaccination campaign to cover 1,50,000 newly arrived children aged six months to 15 years, said Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesperson for the UN agency.\n\nIkhtiyar Aslanov, the ICRC's head of delegation in Bangladesh, said: \"People are fleeing their homes with very few belongings and we hope that we can relieve some of their suffering by providing much needed healthcare, water and food. However, addressing the needs of all people will not be possible without additional donor support.\"\n\nUNHCR Spokesperson Andrej Mahecic also noted that Bangladeshi communities have shown \"remarkable generosity,\" welcoming refugees into their homes and sharing resources with them.\n\nAmong them, UNHCR has appealed for an initial amount of $30 million for its emergency response in the country until the end of year.\n\nSimilarly, UNICEF made an initial appeal for $7.3 million over three months, including almost $3 million for water and sanitation alone, but that amount was calculated on the basis of 200,000 people and that number had now doubled.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister of Turkey Bekir Bozdağ also thanked the government of Bangladesh for hosting a big number of the Rohingya refugees. He reassured the Turkish support-both political and material-for Bangladesh on the issue.\n\nDuring a meeting with Bangladesh Ambassador to Turkey Allama Siddiki in Ankara on Friday, the DPM inquired into the present status of the Rohingya crisis.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
