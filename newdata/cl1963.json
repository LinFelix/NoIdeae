There are also about 100 wounded.\"\n\nReuters TV footage showed more than 30 bodies covered by sheets on the roadside in Kamanyola, with many more wounded also lying in the street.\n\nA UN spokeswoman confirmed that at least 18 Burundian asylum seekers had been killed but said the toll was likely to rise. Many others had taken shelter at the UN peacekeeping mission's nearby base, she added.\n\nAccording to a spokesman for the UN refugee agency, more than 2,000 Burundian refugees live in Kamanyola with host families.\n\nIn a statement, Burundi's main opposition grouping, CNARED, accused Burundian army troops and members of the ruling CNDD-FDD's youth group Imbonerakure of carrying out the killings with the Congolese army.\n\nBurundian officials could not be immediately reached for comment, but Burundi's foreign minister Alain Aime Nyamitwe wrote on Twitter: \"My heart sinks as I learn of the shootings in Eastern #DRC.\"\n\n\"Clarifications are needed on the shootings & circumstances around,\" he added.\n\nThe violence in Burundi has killed over 700 people and a UN commission said last week there were reasonable grounds to believe authorities had committed crimes against humanity. The government rejected the commission's findings as \"propaganda\".","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
