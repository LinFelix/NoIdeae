We like this definition.\n\nBeing unveiled at AFCEA's 2017 Federal Identity Forum & Homeland Security Conference in Washington, the Seamless Totem™ revolutionizes the travel experience, offering a new passenger interaction model via \"on-the-move\" processes and new facial recognition technology.\n\nWashington, USA (PRWEB) September 16, 2017\n\nThe travel industry is changing as worldwide passenger volume increases significantly every year. Airports and airlines have realized they must adopt new strategies to proactively support capacity growth, as well as, lower operational costs, identify new revenue streams, and improve passenger flow for a seamless experience.\n\nIn parallel, law enforcement authorities are coping with the challenge of evolving security threats and must enhance national security, accurately identify individuals crossing borders, and protect a traveler's identity. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is deploying new biometric technologies to verify the identity of travelers at both arrivals and departures. In coordination with other stakeholders, CBP is deploying capabilities to allow automated identity verification using standard traveler data and face biometric verification. These capabilities effectively allow the traveler to use only his or her face and eliminating the need for presenting boarding passes or secure documents during travel.\n\nAt the AFCEA 2017 Federal Identity Forum & Homeland Security in Washington, Vision-Box is launching the Seamless Totem™ - an industry game-changer, revolutionizing passenger experience, security and efficiency in operations.\n\nA new multi-context biometric totem solution sets the basis for Seamless Travel, offering a quick enrollment & recognition modality to identify travelers. The Seamless Totem™ features new face detection capabilities to be used in a variety of contexts, from check-in, through border control, to boarding, and also usable at land borders or seaports.\n\nAdvancing the concept of the non-stop and contactless airport passenger journey, Vision-Box is presenting a new on-the-move, contactless, streamlined experience for travelers, which eliminates stops at control points, representing the next evolutionary step in the way citizens and passengers interact with travel stakeholders or the government.\n\nThe new traveler interaction points are self-service, with minimum size and environmental footprint. Biometrically enabled for speedy on-the-go transactions, Internet of Things (IoT) ready for full connectivity with a common-use orchestration platform, modular for maximum flexibility and ease of operations, The Seamless Totem™ offers exceptional human factors with new personalized engagement based on state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) and smart ergonomics technologies.\n\nAdditionally, The Seamless Totem™ solves the challenge of biometric capture quality as well as recognition at both short and long range with the new high-end cameras which can literally follow passengers as they move. The Seamless Totem™ significantly improves imaging capabilities, capturing a high-resolution ICAO-compliant photo of every traveler, on the move and in real time; selecting the best image to be matched against the images already on file. A high quality biometric data input is then provided to perform the match against the reference images. These benefits effectively optimize back office operations, generate efficiencies and allow to focus on actual exceptions or law enforcement situations.\n\nWhen launching the new solution, CEO Miguel Leitmann said \"Deploying an integrated biometrically enhanced solution across the US with the new multifunction biometric totem for enrollment and identification will represent a huge boost in traveler experience and public safety. The new IoT device puts forward the most efficient and reliable facial recognition technology ever, with a low impact in the environment and minimal disruption in people flow. It is made possible by capturing a high quality photo of every individual, on-the-move, as the traveler naturally walks at normal pace. While regular travelers will move seamlessly across travel hubs, such as airports, seaports or land borders, Border Protection authorities can dedicate their full attention in managing exceptions and urgency situations\".\n\nIn fact, besides establishing a new standard in traveler experience, collecting high quality data from a variety of sources will enhance the matching process against government databases as well as improve the ability to deploy important analytics to improve security. The Seamless Totem™ offers an accurate establishment of the identity of individuals travelling, reliable vetting of foreign visitors, and the immediate and unequivocal recognition of those overstaying their visas or listed as suspects.\n\nThe Seamless Totem™ is also adaptable to Civil ID, presenting a reliable biometric and biographic enrollment as well as friction-less authentication tool. Citizen-centric, fully connected and offering the best-in-market image quality, the new Vision-Box Seamless Totem™ enables more secure borders and the integrity of Identity in the fast evolving Digital Era.\n\nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http:\/\/www.prweb.com\/releases\/2017\/09\/prweb14696769.htm","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
