While many of her pieces show this, the poem âThe soul of the African womanâ expresses it best, as she writes:\n\nOh the grace, indeed! Ngasi writes with a grace and poignancy that will resonate with every reader. Composed of two decades' worth of poems that chronicle her heartbreaks, triumphs and self-discovery, the book explores the complexities of being female.\n\nWhile some of the pieces are more light-hearted, such as âIt comes with the boobsâ or even âThe mirror liesâ, which looks at the realities of ageing, others command attention, making you sit that little bit straighter, read that little bit harder and feel her emotions through her words.\n\nThe poem that shares the name of her book stands out the most for me. âBlack-tipped nipplesâ is a defiant call to remembrance. To remember where we came from and our ties to slavery and racism. It tells those who would put us down and bury our strengths that we will not be silenced. It says, âI am here! I am alive!â\n\nNgasi dedicated her book to women, and I would recommend that every girl and every woman reads it to reinforce the strength we need when facing adversity. But even more so, it is for everyone who wants a deeper understanding of what is like to be a black woman.\n\nQ & A WITH MILDRED NGESA\n\nYou are an award-winning journalist and now a poet. What has prompted you to take this route? I believe the art of writing is vibrant enough to accommodate different genres and specialties. I am still a journalist, mostly focusing on print media. I cherish the written word and have a personal inclination towards the magical impact of neatly woven words. To me, poetry is the language of the heart. It is through poetry that we convey the unspoken and unmask the hidden truths about what we truly feel. Therefore, I affirm the power of the pen and have now effortlessly glided towards poetry. It is a very natural progression, in my view.\n\nThe title of your anthology, âBlack-Tipped Nipplesâ, is very intriguing. What exactly does it allude to? Many people are stunned at the title and at face value, some immediately think the title alludes to something sensual or seductive, but this is far from it. In fact, the poem from which the title is derived speaks of lamentations against oppression and racism. But then again, the interpretation of poetry is left to the reader. The most that the poet can do is weave the lines and let them fly onto whatever interpretation.\n\nThe brief on your book indicates that the poetry seeks to lift the lid off racism, social stigmatisation and relationship stereotypes. Why is this important? My collection speaks of the many gaps and stereotypes we see in our everyday lives. We live at a time when homophobia is rising in different aspects, racism is re-manifesting itself through paranoia, and relationships are fizzling into stormy judgmental platforms and stigmatised enclaves. All these give rise to a social disharmony that provokes the creative mind. This is where my motivation is sourced.\n\nYour poems are quiet misty, almost personal and mostly written in the first-person narrative. Are they all based on personal experiences? (Laughs) I am a human being with a heart, and a heart is as fluid as the emotions that define our everyday experiences. I write what I feel and I feel what I write. Then again, we live among people who walk through spectacular and life-changing paths. Women empathise with other women in many ways, and to me, the story of every woman is indeed my story, and so I write of every woman!\n\nThere are at least three poems within that seem to celebrate the African woman. Was this intentional within the entire collection? How can it not be?! Like I say, ââ|To every womanist, every activist, every feminist, every humanist; the reality of what it truly means to be an African queen is to champion the cause to the wind.â The African woman is my key inspiration.\n\nThis is your debut book. Are there plans for more? Where can one purchase a copy? Yes, this is my debut book. I have yet another book that will be out by the end of October; this time in celebration of the bravery of the girl child. I purpose to keep up the writing streak because in my view, writing is me.\n\nThis book can be requested online though www.mildredngesa.com and is also available at the Yaya Centre Bookshop and the Prestige Book Store bordering Mama Ngina Street. It will soon be on Amazon and other locations countrywide.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
