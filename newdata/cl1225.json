In this interview with ISAAC SHOBAYO, Barrister Fuanter speaks on the formation of the club, members contributions and other related activities of the club.\n\nPlateau club was founded in 1921 by the then colonial administration in Plateau province, being one of the clubs that were founded all over the country.\n\nThe whole idea then was to find a meeting point between the colonial administrators, business class that represented the Royal Niger Company and miners who were represented by the Amalgamated Tin Mining Company.\n\nIt was more or less a meeting point between the people in government, business class and the entrepreneur class. Since then, the clubs has consistently maintained its ideals.\n\nIt started as a golf club, it was one of the earliest golf clubs that were founded on the Plateau but was later balkanised, part of it was ceded to the Central Bank of Nigeria, Saint Piran Church, COCIN church, all these places were formerly part and parcel of Plateau Club. But for the reason of development they have to move the golf club to the present Lamingo Golf Club. Basically, the history of the club is dated back to 1921.\n\nOne of the prominent members of the club who is of international repute is the former Prime Minister of Britain, John Major, who worked here in Jos with the Standard Chartered Bank (now First Bank) between 1965 -- 66. Overtime, he was a president of Plateau Club before he travelled back to Britain and later became the Prime Minister.\n\nThe club has, over the years, played her corporate social responsibility to the society. Contrary to what people think, it is never a drinking club, it is a sporting club where people come to unwind, play games, sit down to discuss business, politics and other life issues. It is made up of people of high class.\n\nSometime in 1984, Chris Mamah was playing lawn tennis here, he was sponsored by individuals members of the club to go outside the country to play tennis. He subsequently played tennis in United States of America and ended up forming his tennis clinic where the likes of Williams sisters trained.\n\nThrough his personal efforts, he took along with him nine other young men from Plateau state who are presently doing well in that country. So also is Squash, some of the talents playing squash in Nigeria today were trained in this club, most coaches came here to train them, the number 2 woman champion in Nigeria is from Plateau Club and also other younger stars that are coming up.\n\nI believe there is a purpose for establishing this club, has the club achieved the purpose?\n\nYes, often time you see politicians here especially those who are members of the club discussing issues irrespective of their political affiliations and at the end agreed on issues to move the state and Nigeria toward.\n\nIf you take a census of our members you find business men, politicians, elite and other interest groups within the society they are represented, they often sit down to discuss national issues bordering on national development, they are professionals from various disciplines. This has helped me as a commissioner in this administration, their suggestions and advice through interactions have helped me in many ways.\n\nIn terms of socio responsibility, what has Plateau club done for the society?\n\nThis club can be run by ten staff but as it is now, we have more than twenty five staff. We are concern about taking people off the streets, we house them, there is one particular staff who has been working here for the past forty years, the club sponsored one of his children up to degree level, the young man is presently doing his master degree programme and his father is still working with the club. Members in the past had collectively intervened in many ways, especially when there is disaster, crisis etc. We often go to the hospitals and prison to make sure we do our corporate social responsibilities.\n\nCan you mention some of the prominent members of the club and their contributions to the development of Plateau club?\n\nWe are in touch with the former Prime Minister of Britain, Mr. John Major, he has shown interest in coming for the centenary celebration of this club which will come up in three years' time. We have booked him ahead of the anniversary, he has given us his words.\n\nHe also made a commitment that there are still some miners who worked in Plateau in Britain who were members of the club when they were in Nigeria and promised to take them along when coming. But back home, there is no any important person in Plateau state that had not at one time or the other been a member of the club.\n\nArchitect Pam Dung Gyang is the Chairman Board of Trustee, other members include Engineer Jimmy Cheto, Peter Adeyinka among others. We also have Zakari who joined the club about fifty years ago, Sir, Fedelis Tapgun, John Alkali, the late Chief Solomon Lar, former Governor Joshua Dariye and the current governor of Plateau State Barrister Simon Lalong.\n\nDoes Plateau Club have any relationship with other similar clubs across the country?\n\nAll the clubs that were established around the same time are sister clubs. If you are talking of Apapa club, Ikeja, Ibadan tennis club, Enugu among others, they are in collaboration with one another. Once you are a member of Plateau club or any other clubs of similar status, you are equally by commitment member of other clubs, you will be accorded the same respect. That is why if you apply yo be a member of Plateau Club your photograph is supposed to be displayed in other clubs, so that we don't register members that are not of good standing in the society, so all other clubs in the country are affiliated, Plateau club is a sister to other clubs in the country.\n\nBasically our source of funding the club is through subscription by members and registration of new member. A new member is supposed to register with N100,000 while every member is expected to pay annual subscription fee of N20, 000 and we have membership strength of about 5, 000 but because of the economic situation, the active members are not up to 1, 000. We complement such funding with the rent from shops within the club premises. Presently, the lawn tennis is being renovated likewise other sport facilities within the club premises. Members also help in contributing money outside their subscription to do one thing or the other. But for our indigent members majority of whom are retirees, we try to give them succour by waving their subscriptions.\n\nConstitutionally, the grand patron of the club is the governor o=f the state while the patron is the state chairman of the state Traditional Council. The trustee are the custodian of the club properties while elected executives committee is vested with responsibility of day to day running of the club.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 19:33:30.988"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 19:33:29.822","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|M3K0eS1aZQOLcd8\/Fsjt2GWu4UQ=|jGsJzK4mI23sbfgkXts+9IytNdg4tdL8I4AQjq3TPAOsm\/RxBdXltQ==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1cc59d56-cb11-3952-b3ad-d0bb44d70952\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":0.615,"name":"Sports"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1cc59d56-cb11-3952-b3ad-d0bb44d70952\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1cc59d56-cb11-3952-b3ad-d0bb44d70952\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1cc59d56-cb11-3952-b3ad-d0bb44d70952\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/2dbbfa03-ce72-3d40-a076-4e6a0f2fec52","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Club","importance":"1","originalValue":"Club (organization)"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1cc59d56-cb11-3952-b3ad-d0bb44d70952\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1cc59d56-cb11-3952-b3ad-d0bb44d70952\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/ff136e7e-a37e-3ca5-a0e0-fdc67f148290","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Plateau State","importance":"1","originalValue":"Plateau State"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1cc59d56-cb11-3952-b3ad-d0bb44d70952\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1cc59d56-cb11-3952-b3ad-d0bb44d70952\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/8d329ab6-a43b-368b-a774-e301f89f1326","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Jos","importance":"1","originalValue":"Jos"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1cc59d56-cb11-3952-b3ad-d0bb44d70952\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1cc59d56-cb11-3952-b3ad-d0bb44d70952\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/979e963d-af15-36b8-a7f0-67a72dd1c090","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Geography of Nigeria","importance":"2","originalValue":"Geography of Nigeria"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1cc59d56-cb11-3952-b3ad-d0bb44d70952\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1cc59d56-cb11-3952-b3ad-d0bb44d70952\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/8ffb3118-c879-36b1-bfa4-80e7d01e376d","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Collaroy Plateau","importance":"2","originalValue":"Collaroy Plateau"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/1cc59d56-cb11-3952-b3ad-d0bb44d70952\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Banks -
