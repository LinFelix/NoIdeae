Caglayan was also charged with taking\nbribes in cash and jewellery worth tens of millions of dollars.\n\"There are truly some problematic issues regarding this\nperiod, and the wrongful steps taken by those under President\nTrump are evidently casting a shadow on Trump's administration.\nI don't think this should be allowed,\" Erdogan said in an\ninterview with broadcaster A Haber.\nLast week Erdogan said he had told Washington that Turkey\nhad never agreed to comply with its sanctions on Iran, and\ncalled on the United States to review the indictment.\nHe also said Trump had called him and vowed to follow the\ncase more closely.\nOn Monday Turkey said Caglayan had acted within\ninternational law and that charges against him amounted to a\ncoup attempt through American courts.\nRelations between Washington and NATO ally Turkey, an\nimportant partner in tackling the Syrian conflict, have become\nmore strained following last year's failed military coup in\nTurkey and Erdogan's subsequent crackdown on his opponents.\nAnkara is seeking - so far without success - the extradition\nof a U.S.-based Muslim cleric whom it accuses of orchestrating\nthe coup attempt. The cleric, Fethullah Gulen, denies\ninvolvement in the abortive coup.\nErdogan will travel to the United States on Sunday for the\nUnited Nations General Assembly in New York and is due to meet\nTrump on the sidelines of that event.\n(Reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by Gareth Jones)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
