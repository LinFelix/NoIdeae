Korea missile flew about 2,300 miles, could reach\nGuam\n* U.S. running out of patience - McMaster\n* China says options should include direct talks\nBy Jeff Mason and Michelle Nichols\nWASHINGTON\/UNITED NATIONS, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The United\nStates said on Friday it had military options to deal with North\nKorea, signalling its patience for diplomacy is wearing thin\nafter Pyongyang fired a missile over Japan and into the Pacific\nOcean for the second time in under a month.\nIn the latest attempt to deal with an issue that has\nrepeatedly frustrated world powers, the U.N. Security Council\ncondemned the \"highly provocative\" missile launch by North\nKorea.\nThe council's 15 members had already stepped up sanctions\nagainst North Korea in response to a nuclear bomb test it staged\non Sept. 3, imposing a ban on North Korea's textile exports and\ncapping its imports of crude oil.\nWhite House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said the\nUnited States was fast running out of patience for diplomatic\nsolutions on North Korea's missile and nuclear programs.\n\"We've been kicking the can down the road, and we're out of\nroad,\" McMaster told reporters, referring to Pyongyang's\nrepeated missile tests in defiance of international pressure.\n\"For those ... who have been commenting on a lack of a\nmilitary option, there is a military option,\" he said, adding\nthat it would not be the Trump administration's preferred\nchoice.\nU.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley echoed\nMcMaster's strong rhetoric, even as Washington continued to\nemphasise that its preferred resolution to the crisis is through\ndiplomacy and sanctions.\n\"What we are seeing is, they are continuing to be\nprovocative, they are continuing to be reckless and at that\npoint there's not a whole lot the Security Council is going to\nbe able to do from here, when you've cut 90 percent of the trade\nand 30 percent of the oil,\" Haley said.\n\"So having said that, I have no problem kicking it to\n(Defense Secretary Jim) General Mattis because I think he has\nplenty of options,\" said Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the\nUnited Nations.\nNorth Korea has launched dozens of missiles under leader Kim\nJong Un as it accelerates a weapons program designed to give it\nthe ability to target the United States with a powerful,\nnuclear-tipped missile.\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson accused North Korea of\nthreatening the entire world.\n\"In East Asia, an increasingly aggressive and isolated\nregime in North Korea threatens democracies in South Korea,\nJapan, and more importantly, and more recently, has expanded\nthose threats to the United States, endangering the entire\nworld,\" Tillerson said in a speech to foreign officials.\nLATEST MISSILE\nNorth Korea's latest test missile flew over Hokkaido in\nnorthern Japan on Friday and landed in the Pacific about 2,000\nkm (1,240 miles) to the east, the Japanese government said.\nIt travelled about 3,700 km (2,300 miles) in total,\naccording to South Korea's military, far enough to reach the\nU.S. Pacific territory of Guam, which the North has threatened\nbefore.\n\"The range of this test was significant since North Korea\ndemonstrated that it could reach Guam with this missile,\" the\nUnion of Concerned Scientists advocacy group said in a\nstatement. However, the accuracy of the missile, still at an\nearly stage of development, was low, it said.\nOn Thursday, Tillerson called on China, Pyongyang's only\nally, and Russia to apply more pressure on North Korea by\n\"taking direct actions of their own.\"\nBut Beijing pushed back.\nForeign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying denied that China\nheld the key to easing tension on the Korean peninsula and said\nthat duty lay with the parties directly involved. She also\nreiterated China's position that sanctions on North Korea are\nonly effective if paired with talks.\nNorth Korea staged its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb\ntest earlier this month and in July tested long-range\nintercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching at least\nparts of the U.S. mainland.\nLast month, North Korea fired an intermediate range missile\nthat also flew over Hokkaido into the ocean.\nWarning announcements about the latest missile blared around\n7 a.m. (2200 GMT Thursday) in parts of northern Japan, while\nmany residents received alerts on their mobile phones or saw\nwarnings on TV telling them to seek refuge.\nThe U.S. military said it had detected a single intermediate\nrange ballistic missile but it did not pose a threat to North\nAmerica or Guam.\nOn global markets, shares and other risk assets barely moved\nand gold fell as traders paid little attention to the latest\nmissile test, shifting their focus to where and when interest\nrates will go up.\n\nDIFFERENCES OVER DIRECT TALKS\nU.S. President Donald Trump has promised not to allow North\nKorea to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped\nmissile. He is due to meet with South Korean and Japanese\nleaders next week in New York.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin discussed the launch in a\nphone call with French President Emanuel Macron and agreed on\nthe need for a diplomatic solution, including through resuming\ndirect talks on North Korea.\nAsked about the prospect for direct talks, a White House\nspokesman said, \"As the president and his national security team\nhave repeatedly said, now is not the time to talk to North\nKorea.‚Äù\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in also said dialogue with\nthe North was impossible at this point. He ordered officials to\nanalyse and prepare for possible new North Korean threats,\nincluding electromagnetic pulse and biochemical attacks.\nThe United States and South Korea are technically still at\nwar with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended\nwith a truce and not a peace treaty. The North accuses the\nUnited States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of\nplanning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its\nAsian allies.\n(Reporting by Jack Kim and Christine
