This is partly thanks to the club's plans to establish 11 brand new teams.\n\nBDFC currently has 22 teams, ranging from under-7 to adult level, which play in a number of leagues.\n\nThe club also plan to introduce a girls' under-14 and under-16 side, which will help to boost female football participation at the facility by 122 per cent across all ages.\n\nThe facility will also be used by Burscough Priory High School, Digmoor FC and Sacre Coeur FP FC's over-40 team.\n\nIt is hoped that the new hub can also support cricket sessions, and will be used by local primary schools for PE classes.\n\nFunding for the improvements was made available via a £98,043 grant from the Premier League and The FA Facilities Fund , delivered by the Football Foundation.\n\nSimon Kenyon, the chairman of Burscough Dynamo Football Club, said: \"I would like to thank the Premier League and The FA Facilities Fund for the grant.\n\n\"The funding will allow the facility to be used once again mainly for grassroots football, but will allow us to offer cricket and other sports.\n\n\"It will also allow Burscough Dynamo FC to develop its mini-soccer, adult football and female football sections, as well as offering holiday activities and other sporting opportunities.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
