Among elementary schools, the lowest performers in Staunton and Waynesboro also have the children who face the greatest economic challenges.\n\nCue the school board hand-wringing. Cue the earnest promises to try one more thing, adjust one more approach, layer on one more support program.\n\nAnd maybe those schools' scores on Virginia's Standards of Learning tests will creep up a bit next year. Even if accreditation is not fully achieved, the district will claim a partial victory and do it all again.\n\nBut, seriously, is even full accreditation enough?\n\nAccreditation is achieved when roughly three quarters of youngsters taking SOLs answered at least two-thirds of the questions correctly. That's hardly excellence, nor is it the once promised \"no child left behind.\"\n\nWe're not sure that even accredited schools are properly equipping students for successful 21st century lives. The system relies too much on rote learning, too little on understanding and sucks too much creativity out of classrooms. SOLs set a low floor. Districts in many areas of the commonwealth, breeze past those benchmarks and climb higher. The highest achieving offer soaring menus of electives, support extra-curriculars spanning interests far beyond sports and even set up broad AP and International Baccalaureate programs that hew to a much higher set of standards. These are the students with whom our children and grandchildren will compete for college slots, for jobs, for advancement. What makes us think they'll be ready?\n\nBut here in the Valley, we're just trying to find a way to get kids -- largely disadvantaged kids -- out of the testing basement. It's segregating children by family income. And we're trying for incremental solutions. That's not enough.\n\nThe time Waynesboro started to think differently about truly changing the system for the better was in 2010. It explored an idea that has caught on in some other areas of the country. It would explode the community school model, which has sentimental support but is also the reason why some schools are held back year after year after year.\n\nInstead, all students of a given elementary grade from a broad region, or even the entire district would attend the same school. A school might only have two or three grades total. Students from disadvantaged families would go to school with students of privilege. All of a grade's teachers could work together, plan together and teach together in a single building. Resources in that building could be age and developmentally specific.\n\nIn this system, no one school would need to program for a disproportionate share of disadvantaged children, and no school would get a free ride because of relative privilege. It would be even. Each school, too, would have a share of the type of supportive parent engagement usually found in more affluent schools. A more diverse student body could break down other social barriers that children now meet head-on at the middle school door.\n\nThese schools, it would seem, should have a better chance of meeting state benchmarks. If they don't, everyone in the district, from the doctor and lawyer to the assembly worker to the retail clerk, would have reason to make certain that the school succeeds. Nothing gives a politician political will to do right by education than making sure his or her children are directly affected by their decisions. Suddenly, everyone has a dog in the hunt, and that's a good thing.\n\nIn the version of this plan Waynesboro considered and then rejected, two buildings would have been lower elementary schools and two would have been upper. In Staunton, perhaps one school would have kindergarten and first, another second and third, one would have fourth and fifth. Transportation would be more complicated, but it can't be more complicated than the constant reengineering of curriculum, staff and support at Bessie Weller Elementary.\n\nAnd if not this particular type of overhaul, then something equally radical needs to be tried. It has to remind every parent that they have a personal stake in the education of all children, not just their own. And that realization -- that this isn't just a Bessie Weller or Wenonah or William Perry problem. It's a community problem, and one we have to solve before we can really address all the other shortcomings that threaten to leave our children behind their peers from other districts.\n\nOur View represents the opinion of our Editorial Board: Roger Watson, president; David Fritz, executive editor; William Ramsey, news director.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story:
