He resigned days later.\n\nAround the same time, Dave McClure, a general partner at 500 Startups, faced similar allegations of inappropriate advances toward female entrepreneurs. McClure admitted to and apologized for being a \"creep\" and announced that he would be moving to a limited role at the company. He resigned shortly thereafter.\n\nAlthough sexual harassment allegations have become a thorn in the side of many tech companies, they could be particularly damaging for SoFi, which is trying to persuade regulators to let it open a bank.\n\nThe company offers mortgages and student loan refinancing but wants to expand into providing credit cards and checking accounts. To do that, the company needs regulators to grant it a state bank charter and federal deposit insurance. The allegations of sexual harassment and other problems could be factors in that process.\n\nBank analyst Bert Ely said regulators will look at, among other things, potential reputational risks at SoFi when deciding whether to sign off on its plans. Getting rid of Cagney could smooth out that process.\n\n\"There's the reputation of the institution, and the reputation of the people who run it,\" he said. \"Equifax has a very serious reputation problem, but it's a problem of the company. SoFi seems to have a problem with its now-departed CEO.\"\n\nStill, the resignation is also likely to mean delays for SoFi's charter and insurance applications, meaning the company may have to hold off on its planned expansion into banking, said Brian Knight, a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center.\n\n\"Part of the application is, 'Who is your leadership team, and do regulators feel comfortable that this leadership team can maintain safety and soundness at the bank?\" Knight said. \"They're going to need to figure who that leadership team will be, and then have regulators look at them.\"\n\nCagney's resignation was spurred by a lawsuit filed Aug. 11 by former employee Brandon Charles, who was hired as a manager at the company's office in Healdsburg in Sonoma County.\n\nHe alleged SoFi had fired him for trying to report bad practices at the company, including sexual harassment by a manager at the Healdsburg office and the mishandling of loan applications at another office in Salt Lake City.\n\nOn Aug. 31, Charles amended the suit to include Cagney as a named defendant, alleging the CEO made sexual comments about female employees and fostered a culture that allowed sexual harassment to continue unabated.\n\nTimes staff writer James Rufus Koren contributed to this report.\n\ntracey.lien@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @traceylien\n\nUPDATES:\n\n11:15 a.m.:
