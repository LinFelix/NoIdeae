Or rather, their special fishing spots being shared.\n\n\"This is untested technology, we'd like opportunity to slow down a bit, talk to MPI and get this right, because if we get it wrong it's going to be very hard to unwind,\" Fisheries Inshore's Jeremy Helson says\n\nDeep sea trawlers must be compliant with the new technology by October 2017, with inshore operators by April next year.\n\nMPI also disputes claims from fishers the cost of upgrading their boats is upwards of $18000, saying their own estimate is close to $7000.\n\n\"We appreciate that there will be a cost to industry in implementing digital monitoring, however it is not the intention to drive fishers out of the sector, we want to work with all fishers to make sure they get the system up and running,\" MPI Manager, Digital Monitoring Matt Perkins said.\n\nBut, despite the regulations already being passed by Cabinet Carey and Hayley hope it's not too late to make some exemptions.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
