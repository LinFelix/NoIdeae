The march also featured several progressive speakers, including Ferrara who has advocated for Latino and immigrant issues.\n\nClinton has shown her support for the Women's March on several occasions, thanking protesters for \"marching for our values.\"\n\nIn her 2016 election memoir \"What Happened,\" Clinton said that she stayed home to watch the march instead of participating.\n\n\"If I showed up, nasty politics would unavoidably follow\" despite her being \"upset and worried for the country,\" she said.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
