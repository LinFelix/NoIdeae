It is amazing for groups such as ourselves to have this opportunity from a fantastic local company that seems to really care about the community, helping others and supporting several worthy charities. We are so thankful to Mick George Ltd.\"\n\nIt is anticipated that the funds will be utilised to add a new fully sprung cheerleading floor which will compliment the existing facilities, helping the group achieve its mission of 'some want it to happen, East Elite make it happen'.\n\nSet out to provide top quality coaching, East Elite Allstars is a friendly team with a great ethos, consisting of over 100 athletes ranging from ages 4 - 27, and this isn't the first time a Cheerleading Team has benefitted from this competition.\n\nThis time last year, it was Unity Gold Cheerleading that cleaned up the money.\n\nJon Stump, Finance Director at Mick George Ltd commented: \"It was fantastic to see the community embrace the Skip of Gold competition, the support that the various groups received was overwhelming.\n\n\"This is the third time that we have run the competition in Peterborough and it's clear to see by the vast number of entries just how important this support can be for the development of each nomination.\"\n\nStump Continued: \"We are very active within the Peterborough area supporting activities, individuals, clubs and charities at all levels. The Mick George Skip of Gold competition provides a little more insight to what the community really care about and are involved in within their daily lives.\n\n\"The £1,000 prize fund will undoubtedly make a real difference, and should help build to a brighter future. We are proud of our community initiatives and look forward to any forthcoming engagement.\"","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
