We support a wide range of different sports clubs across the UK, from Aberdeen Wanderers Rugby Club, to Coventry Blaze Ice Hockey and Manningtree girls' football team.\"\n\nHe continued: \"As a company, we are always looking for ways to give back to the community so being involved in these awards shows our commitment to this.\"\n\nThe awards, which will be held on October 5 at the city's Ricoh Arena, are a fantastic way to raise the profile of sport at all levels and can work to bring communities together, as David confirms: \"Sport has a positive impact on the community by being a great way for people to build skills in teamwork and communication, plus it has excellent health and wellbeing benefits.\n\n\"It's important to celebrate those who put their heart and soul into sport whether that's through playing, coaching or supporting.\"\n\nAlong with the Amateur Sportsman of the Year Award, a further 12 awards will be presented on the evening including Club of the Year, Professional Sportswoman of the Year, as well as the Lifetime Achievement Award, which will be presented to the sportsperson who, over at least 15 years, has made a lasting impact on the region's sport.\n\nFor the full list of awards, and to find out more about the nomination process, teams, clubs and individuals are invited to visit www.coventrysportsawards.co.uk\/2017\/, but hurry, as nominations close on September 1.\n\nAlternatively, to find out more about the awards, contact Katy Hedge at event organisers, Champions (UK) plc, on 08453 31 30
