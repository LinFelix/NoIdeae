Those convicted could receive anything from 30 years to life imprisonment. However, there is no such ban on lesbian sex.\n\nRecent crackdown on gays\n\nUntil recently the gay community in Tanzania had not be subjected to levels of discrimination seen in other African countries, such as neighboring Uganda.\n\nPoliticians had largely ignored the gay community until a recent spike in anti-gay rhetoric by the government.\n\nDeputy Health Minister Hamisi Kingwangalla vowed in front of parliament Friday to \"fight with all our strength against groups supporting homosexuality in our country.\"\n\nThe government has recently vowed to deport foreigners who \"campaign for homosexuality.\"\n\nDozens of men suspected of being gay have been arrested and taken hospital for anal exams that allegedly confirm their homosexuality.\n\nIn July 2016 sexual lubricants were banned by the government. Health Minister Ummy Mwalimu said they encouraged homosexuality which led to the spread of HIV\/AIDS.\n\nHomosexuality is illegal in 38 of 54 African countries. It is punishable by death in Mauritania, Sudan and Somalia, according to Amnesty International.\n\nIn 2014 Uganda sought to impose the death penalty on those convicted of being homosexual, but the controversial law was later repealed.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
