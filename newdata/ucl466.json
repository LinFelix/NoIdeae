(http:\/\/reut.rs\/2f0fEte)\nA former Wells Fargo trader and hedge fund manager, Cagney co-founded SoFi in 2011 to compete with banks in the student loan market.\nSoFi targeted students from elite institutions such as Stanford and Harvard and young people skeptical of traditional banks in the wake of the financial crisis flocked to the new platform.\nIn a note to employees on Monday, Cagney said \"a combination of HR-related litigation and negative press have become a distraction from the company's core mission\" to focusing attention on him personally.\nSoFi has a non-traditional work culture, hosting cocktail parties, yoga sessions and singles meetups for its customers, which it refers to as members.\nThe company's recent woes echo problems elsewhere in the technology sector.\nRide-hailing company Uber, also based in San Francisco, is struggling to overcome allegations of sexual harassment and executive misconduct. Venture capitalists have also faced criticism over their treatment of female entrepreneurs.\n\n (Reporting By Aparajita Saxena and Diptendu Lahiri in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Sai Sachin Ravikumar)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16 10:45:35.131"},"meta":{"contentType":"text\/raw","processingVer":"AllMetadata","serverVersion":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE:169","stagsVer":"OneCalais_11.0-RELEASE-b10-2017-07-31_12:36:53","submissionDate":"2017-09-16 10:45:34.807","submitterCode":"0ca6a864-5659-789d-5f32-f365f695e757","signature":"digestalg-1|HHpkcNdXyPu33TFGXvRizK\/yl80=|KaSoexhsfe0OaRP0+XOOFTlOXHiCX8I+DrbiQZs13EOFdRN2LNsI2A==","language":"English"}},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/cat\/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","forenduserdisplay":"false","score":1,"name":"Business_Finance"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/lid\/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/lid\/DefaultLangId\/English","forenduserdisplay":"false","permid":"505062"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/SocialTag\/1":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/SocialTag\/1","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/ccf0e1fa-ed07-3221-ab74-247dbd589bdc","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Feminism","importance":"1","originalValue":"Feminism"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/SocialTag\/2":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/SocialTag\/2","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/131825b8-da79-3da3-b023-ea477cd9dc15","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Human sexuality","importance":"1","originalValue":"Human sexuality"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/SocialTag\/3":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/SocialTag\/3","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/01ff61e5-8b81-3b93-a8d8-5b66aefaa0e3","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Transport","importance":"1","originalValue":"Transport"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/SocialTag\/4":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/SocialTag\/4","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/9a51b1e4-a870-3056-9c97-1232fb13133b","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"SoFi","importance":"2","originalValue":"SoFi"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/SocialTag\/5":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/SocialTag\/5","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/c3f5e8a2-2dbd-3602-a972-9f97ddb929b6","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Social finance","importance":"2","originalValue":"Social finance"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/SocialTag\/6":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/SocialTag\/6","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/8ac19371-a8ee-3c81-9723-4c8806e8fded","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Uber","importance":"2","originalValue":"Uber (company)"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/SocialTag\/7":{"_typeGroup":"socialTag","id":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/SocialTag\/7","socialTag":"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/genericHasher-1\/15c8e967-91da-34b9-8c96-8cde1fce9c86","forenduserdisplay":"true","name":"Sexual harassment","importance":"2","originalValue":"Sexual harassment"},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/Industry\/1":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Mobile Application Software","rcscode":"B:1800","permid":"4294951201","relevance":0.2},"http:\/\/d.opencalais.com\/dochash-1\/84fdd22e-86e3-3457-89b6-660ad4c4fc1d\/Industry\/2":{"_typeGroup":"industry","forenduserdisplay":"false","name":"Banks -
