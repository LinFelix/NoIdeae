We want everything for our own tribe -- right now, without discussion or compromise. Recently we've heard that about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\n\nBut how can an approach that sees no compromise work in a diverse society, especially when we use our own language and appeal to our own values to persuade others to see our viewpoint?\n\nSee the value in charter schools? You must be against public education and want to hoard opportunity for your own children at others' expense. See immigration as a balancing act between compassion and the rule of law? You lack empathy, or, if you support immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship you're selling out your own race.\n\nTake some on the left insisting white people admit to having 'white privilege.' This narrative only appeals to other liberals. Many lower and middle-class Americans can't embrace 'white privilege' when they've seen their own fortunes decline. We argue over whose suffering is worse. What's the end game? We shut down necessary conversations when every utterance on race is 'racist' and we demand a group identify as 'privileged.' Does finding solutions that better serve everyone require people to own this identity?\n\nFraming transgender bathroom access as a moral imperative that everyone believe the same things about gender is a nonstarter. Figuring out ways to reasonably accommodate everyone's access with privacy and safety seems more open to compromise. Why not work through these concerns?\n\nShutting down conversations creates backlash when people feel their concerns are ignored, disrespected or trampled on. Solutions without conversation and compromise inevitably collapse.\n\nAre we persuading anyone to see our viewpoint by appealing to our own values? How do we navigate the turbulent waters roiling us almost daily?\n\nWe can recognize we're not going to change anyone's moral ethos they spent a lifetime building nor their culture or history which informs their views. Kim Davis, who refused to sign marriage applications for gay couples in Kentucky, isn't likely to ever embrace gay marriage so let's stop trying to make her and people like her do so. At the time, she was the only one who could sign those applications. That's since been changed. This compromise allows everyone to be accommodated and no one's rights are violated. We didn't need to change her to solve a problem. All such problems won't be so easily solved. That shouldn't stop us from trying.\n\nOr assume most of us want to figure out the right balance between immigration policy and compassion for people already here. Can we balance fairness and compassion with the rule of law? We could, for example, pass the Dream Act but couple it with a sensible immigration law. That is, how do we make this a win for the greatest number of people? Can competing priorities be accommodated? Then we need to convince our legislators to embrace compromise so let's stop voting them out when they do.\n\nI'm persuaded by facts. I'm a problem-solver. I'm also a pragmatist who favors doing the greatest good for the greatest number. Those are my values. Appeal to my values, you'll win my support. That is, for example, I can embrace greater inclusivity of all races and creeds and policies that lead to greater prosperity for others without embracing someone else's label of 'privilege.'\n\nSo let's have the conversations, even if they're uncomfortable. Let's be willing to consider others' concerns, ones you hadn't previously thought of or don't agree with. Don't assume what someone else's motives are, instead ask.\n\nThe only way this experiment in democracy survives is if we are brave enough to speak up but not shout each other down, to listen and lay our defenses down. Let's stop making assumptions and work through the many issues we've kicked down the road and won't be kicked any further.\n\nNot everyone can be open and reasonable but I, like many others, want to solve problems. When there's a problem hear me out and I'll hear you out, find where we can agree and work from there. Stop trying to change me and I won't try to change you. It won't work anyway. Remaining one nation may depend on our ability to refrain from doing so.\n\nMonica Rockwell is a local CPA.
