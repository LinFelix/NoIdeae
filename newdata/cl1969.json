But the Army said it was responding to attacks by militants and denied targeting civilians.\n\nThe new shelters for Rohingyas will be on a site covering about 8 sq km of land, close to established camps which have been overwhelmed by arrivals from Myanmar, the Daily Star reported.\n\nA total of 8,500 temporary toilets will be built and 14 \"makeshift warehouses\" will be set up near the shelters.\n\nThe Disaster Management and Relief Ministry will coordinate the matter with Armed Forces Division, Border Guard Bangladesh, Risk Reduction for Resilient Cities, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, International Organization for Migration, World Food Programme and other agencies to construct these shelter centres within 10 days, the report said.\n\nMeanwhile, a rubella and polio vaccination campaign for 1.5 lakh children of Rohingya refugees started in Bangladesh. All the children, aged between six months and 15 years, will be vaccinated for rubella (measles), Cox's Bazar Civil Surgeon Abdus Salam said.\n\nChildren below five years will be administered polio vaccines while kids from six months to five years will be provided vitamin A capsules, the surgeon said.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef), over 200,000 of the estimated 400,000 Rohingyas who fled violence in Myanmar to Bangladesh since August 25 are children. They are facing challenges of food, nutrition, shelter, water and sanitation. Many of them are traumatised, malnourished and weak.\n\nHealth personnel from Rohingya camp areas in Ukhia and Teknaf said a rising number of people, mostly children, are visiting the health facilities with diarrhea, fever, cold and skin diseases.\n\nThe current humanitarian crisis began following an August 25 attack by the insurgent Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on police and military posts in the northwestern state of Rakhine that had led to a violent offensive by the Myanmar Army.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a
