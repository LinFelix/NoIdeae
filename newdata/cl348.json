Five Canadians in Havana were also\naffected.\nIn some cases the victims heard nothing, while others sensed\ndeafening sound, but all suffered symptoms such as nausea,\ndizziness and temporary hearing or memory loss.\nThe incidents have left a sense of unease among Havana's\ndiplomatic community, various diplomats said, and the Cuban\nForeign Ministry has not provided any explanation to date.\nA months-long investigation by Cuba, the United States and\nCanada into the mysterious affair, unprecedented in modern\ndiplomatic history, has yet to come up with answers as to how\nthe attacks took place, let alone who was behind them.\nCuba has denied involvement. The U.S. State Department has\nnot blamed Havana for the attacks, but asked two Cuban diplomats\nto leave Washington in May. Canada does not intend to take\ndiplomatic action \"at this time,\" an official said in August.\nIn a letter, the five Republicans - Senators Tom Cotton,\nRichard Burr, John Cornyn, Marco Rubio and James Lankford -\nurged Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to remind the Cuban\ngovernment of its responsibility toward diplomats.\n\"Furthermore, we ask that you immediately declare all\naccredited Cuban diplomats in the United States persona non\ngrata and, if Cuba does not take tangible action, close the U.S.\nEmbassy in Havana,\" they wrote.\nAll five are members of the Senate Intelligence Committee,\none of the congressional panels looking into the matter. Burr is\nits chairman and Cornyn is the number two Republican in the\nSenate.\nPresident Donald Trump's fellow Republicans control\nmajorities in both houses of the U.S. Congress.\nThe letter came as the United States was expected to issue\nnew, tighter restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba, as\npart of a partial rollback of the U.S.-Cuban detente by\nPresident Donald Trump. Rubio, a Cuban-American, was a key\nplayer in forging the new, more hostile policy towards the\nisland.\nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a\nrequest for comment on the letter. The seaside U.S. embassy in\nHavana was still closed due to damage in the wake of Hurricane\nIrma, with staff working from the ambassador's residence and\nfrom home.\nA source close to the investigation underway on the island\nsaid the Cubans had been very cooperative, even offering to let\nthe FBI in to investigate for example.\n\"As far as we have ever known, the U.S. officials here in\nCuba have never suspected the Cubans as perpetrating these\nevents,\" the source said.\nForeign policy experts say it is hard to see what Cuba would\nhave to gain from perpetrating attacks on diplomats. It has\nenjoyed good relations with Canada for many years and in 2014\nstarted to normalize relations with its old Cold War enemy the\nUnited States.\nTheories abound. One is that another country like Russia,\nIran or North Korea might want to drive a wedge between Cuba and\nthe west. Another is that there is an internal power struggle\nunderway on the island.\n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle in Washington, Marc Frank and\nSarah Marsh in Havana, David Ljunggren in Ottawa; editing
