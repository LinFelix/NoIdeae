The UNHCR official said the influx began while Bangladesh was trying to mitigate the debacles caused by recent floods, a situation when the country was \"not equipped to cope with large number of new arrivals\".\n\nMahecic said UNHCR found the Myanmar refugees to be in \"real hardship\" and \"some of the most difficult conditions seen in any current refugee situation\". \"In response to the unfolding crisis, over the past three weeks UNHCR has emptied its warehouses in Bangladesh to assist the newly arrived stateless Rohingya refugees,\" he said.\n\nThe UNHCR official said the first 15 of 35 scheduled trucks arrived in Cox's Bazar on Friday with succor, being delivered to Kutupalong and Nayapara Rohingya camps and other sites in south-eastern Bangladesh while delivery of more relief materials were flown to the scene earlier this week.\n\n\"Priority in distribution is given to shelter materials and basic aid items as thousands of new arrivals are struggling to find even rudimentary protection from the elements,\" he said.\n\nMahecic said many Rohingya refugee families were sleeping rough on roadsides and riverbanks while \"we are also witnessing remarkable generosity of Bangladeshi communities in Teknaf and elsewhere who have been welcoming refugees into their homes and sharing resources with them\".\n\nEarlier on September 14, UNHCR and IOM launched the joint appeal seeking enhanced humanitarian assistance for fleeing Rohingyas, fearing their number could exceed a million as surges of the minority ethnic community from Myanmar continued to hit Bangladesh.\n\n\"We urge the international community to step up humanitarian support and come up with help,\" UN's Organisation for Migration's (IOM) operations director Mohammed Abdiker told news conference jointly with UNHCR's George Okoth-Obbo in the capital.\n\nThe statement added: \"We fear the Rohingya influx in Bangladesh may reach 0ne million (10 lakh) by this year if the refugees fleeing violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state continues.\" bss","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
