This he does by collaborating with corporates who can advice the students on the most recent scenario of the sector that they are planning to enter.\n\nChainani confesses that the inspiration for this startup was the confusion that he faced while sitting for job placements while studying at the University of Delhi.\n\n\"There is no point in asking about how to become a good investment banker from someone who has been in the sector for 20-30 years as the career scope keeps evolving very frequently,\" Chainani says.\n\nHe adds that a right perspective can come only from someone who is new and fresh and has faced the challenges that an upcoming fresher is likely to face given the market conditions and the demand of the field.\n\nHe got his first reassurance in 2014 when on a cold December morning, around 70 students from Harvard Business School, Indian Institute of Management- Bangalore(IIM-B), Indian School of Business-Hyderabad (ISB-H) attended his first session called \"CONTANGROW\" where he collaborated with corporate professionals with the right experience to address the students.\n\nApart from Perspectico, another organization called Talent4Assure is helping students by acting as a \"self-enabler\" and helping students assess themselves for competitive examinations as well as for job placements in colleges and universitites.\n\nFounded by Nikita Singhal in 2009, Talent4Assure has been creating standardized and scientific content for entrance examinations like and National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET) for students looking at pursuing a graduate medical course as well as All India Engineerig Entrance Examination (AIEEE) for emgineering courses.\n\n\"Whatever form the education system takes, self assessment will always be the key to gain self confidence and achieve new heights,\" Singhal says.\n\nIt also provides content for examinations like UPSC, SSC, Bank PO etc both online and offline. While offline students are provided with a set of questions, online, the platform involves the elements of time management as well to give them a mock experience of the test they are planning to attempt.\n\nAccording to a study by recruitment agency, Michael Page India, 60% of companies will add new headcount to their businesses in 2017. With startups and e-commerce disrupting the job market, a disruption is also needed in the way students prepare for them.\n\nOther organizations like Coursera, Aspiring Minds, LinkedIn Learning are also engaged in smoothening the transition for students that the changing times are bringing in the job market.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
