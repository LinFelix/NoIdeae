Hand has seen his career soar in recent years and it just got better.\n\nHe is now set a regular face on TV starring in ITV's Cannonball - here's the full lowdown...\n\nRyan is a presenter, comedian, actor and DJ.\n\nStarting off as a runner with BBC Northern Ireland, Ryan landed his first live TV presenting gig on the BBC's Red Button service.\n\nSince then Ryan has presented for ITV's The Magazine, BBC Radio Ulster, Q Radio, National Lottery and he has appeared on Channel 4's Come Dine With Me.\n\nHe has also appeared on The Fall (BBC) and Bodyfixers (E4).\n\nHe now joins Freddie Flintoff, Frankie Bridge, Maya Jama and Radzi Chingyanganya on new ITV show Cannonball.\n\nRyan used to be part of the Loose Women team.\n\nDuring 2016 and 17 he was known for warming up the audience before the presenters came on.\n\nHe would get the crowd ready before the show went live.\n\nThe first episode of Cannonball aired on Saturday September 2 at 7pm on ITV.\n\nThe wet and wild programme was filmed in the balmier climate of the Mediterranean in Valetta, Malta, in late April.\n\nThere will be ten episodes, a Christmas special and a Splash Hits show featuring the highlights from filming.\n\nEach week 24 contestants will face challenges in a custom-built water park, including tackling a giant swing and a launching themselves cannonball-style at a target.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
