Jerry Brown's desk doesn't go as far as the first version.\n\nThat original bill -- which was opposed by the California Police Chiefs Association and California State Sheriffs' Association -- would have restricted state and local law enforcement from using any resources for immigration enforcement unless the person in question has been convicted of a \"violent or serious felony.\"\n\nSEE MORE: The Missouri Senate Censured A Colleague Over Her Comments About Trump\n\nThe final version of the bill expanded the list of convictions that would warrant cooperation with federal immigration agents and allows those agents to interview immigrants in custody. The compromise helped shift the Police Chiefs Association's stance to \"neutral.\" The Sheriffs' Association is still against the bill.\n\nState Sen. Kevin De Le√≥n, who introduced the bill, said it \"reflects the values of who we are as a great state.\" But even with the compromise, others weren't convinced. One lawmaker said the bill would cause \"chaos.\" The Sheriffs' Association said the revised bill still went too far and could endanger public safety.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, there was no response from President Donald Trump, the White House or Department of Justice.\n\nBut the bill's passage comes as a second blow to the Trump administration's hard-line policy on illegal immigration in as many days. On Friday, a judge blocked the Justice Department's bid to withhold money from so-called \"sanctuary cities\" and similar juristictions.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
