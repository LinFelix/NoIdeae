It has also created uncertainty for\nthousands of transgender service members.\nThe Pentagon has until February to provide an implementation\nplan to the White House and until then transgender service\nmembers can serve. Under Obama last year, the Pentagon ended its\nban on transgender people serving openly, calling the\nprohibition outdated.\n\"Current transgender service members will continue to serve\nthroughout the military and continue to receive necessary\nmedical treatment as prescribed by their medical provider,\"\nManning said.\nMattis had directed the deputy secretary of defense and vice\nchairman of the joint chiefs of staff to develop an\nimplementation plan, Manning said. The panel would include other\nsenior military officials, including outside experts.\nSeparately, four U.S. senators, including John McCain, who\nchairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, introduced\nlegislation that would not allow the Pentagon to remove present\nservice members based on their gender identity.\n\"When less than 1 percent of Americans are volunteering to\njoin the military, we should welcome all those who are willing\nand able to serve our country,\" McCain said.\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
