LOUIS, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters poured\ninto St. Louis' streets and some scuffles broke out as they\nvoiced their anger after a Missouri judge on Friday ruled a\nwhite former St. Louis police officer was not guilty of murder\nin the 2011 shooting of a black man.\nWith the National Guard on standby in case of violence,\nauthorities appealed to protesters to march peacefully in a\nstate where racially charged clashes in the nearby city of\nFerguson spawned the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014.\nPolice said a few protesters threw rocks and water bottles,\nwhile witnesses and video showed officers used pepper spray on\nat least five people about a block from the courthouse. About 50\nriot police were on hand, blocking a ramp to a nearby highway.\nJason Stockley, 36, was acquitted of first-degree murder for\nkilling Anthony Lamar Smith, 24. The former policeman, who was\narrested in May 2016, was accused of planting a gun in Smith's\ncar but testified he acted in self-defense.\nAfter the verdict, more than 500 protesters marched in\ndowntown St. Louis, chanting \"No justice, no peace\" and \"Shut it\ndown.\" Some held \"Black Lives Matter\" signs.\n\"I’m sad, I’m hurt, I’m mad,” the Reverend Clinton Stancil\nof the Wayman AME Church in St. Louis said by telephone. “We\nhaven’t made any progress since Ferguson, that’s clear. Cops can\nstill kill us with impunity.\"\nMayor Lyda Krewson and Governor Eric Greitens, who put the\nNational Guard on standby, appealed for calm. Local schools\nplanned early dismissals and businesses shut down.\n\"Frustration, anger, hurt, pain, hope and love all\nintermingle,\" Krewson said in a statement. \"I encourage St.\nLouisans to show each other compassion.\"\nAl Watkins, an attorney for Smith's fiancee, Christina\nWilson, said his client was appalled by the decision. He said\nthe ruling showed prejudice, pointing to a line where the judge\nwrote that an \"urban heroin dealer\" without a weapon would be an\nanomaly.\nJudge Timothy Wilson's highly anticipated ruling was\nannounced more than five weeks after the bench trial ended.\n\"This court, as a trier of fact, is simply not firmly\nconvinced of defendant's guilt,\" he wrote in his ruling.\nWilson said prosecutors also asked the court to consider a\nlesser degree of homicide but they did not prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt that Stockley's use of deadly force was not\njustified in self-defense.\nStockley's attorney, Neil Bruntrager, said the ex-officer on\nFriday was relieved and would seek to rebuild his life. “It’s\nbeen a long road for him,” Bruntrager said.\n\n'THIS AIN'T RIGHT'\nIn recent years grand juries have declined to charge\nofficers involved in the 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown,\n18, which set of nights of violent protest in Ferguson, and the\nchoking death of Eric Garner, 43, in New York. Baltimore police\nofficers also were not convicted in the case of Freddie Gray,\nwho died from a broken neck suffered in a police van in 2015.\nBrown's father, Michael Brown Sr., voiced his frustration\nafter Friday's verdict.\n\"You all know this ain't right and you all continue to do\nthis to us,\" he told a St. Louis Fox television station. \"Like\nwe don't mean nothing, like we're rats, trash, dogs in the\nstreets. Right now, I'm praying for my city because my people\nare tired of this.\"\nProtesters chanted as they marched around downtown, at one\npoint reaching police headquarters before moving on.\n\"What do you say to people here when they have no faith in\nthe system and these buildings,\" said Kevin Nevels, 50, of St.\nLouis, pointing to the courthouse.\nProsecutor Kimberly Gardner said she was disappointed with\nthe verdict and called on protesters to avoid violence.\n“I understand the verdict has created anger and frustration\nfor many in our community,\" she told reporters at the\ncourthouse. \"I am frustrated as well. Destruction of our\ncommunity is not the answer.\"\nSmith tried to flee from Stockley on Dec. 20, 2011,\nfollowing an alleged drug deal, authorities said. During the\npursuit, Stockley could be heard saying on an internal police\ncar video he was going to kill Smith, prosecutors said.\nAt Stockley's direction, the driver of the police car\nslammed into Smith's vehicle and they came to a stop, court\ndocuments said. Stockley then approached Smith's car and shot\nhim five times with his service weapon.\nStockley's lawyers said he fired in self-defense, believing\nSmith was reaching for a gun. But prosecutors said the only gun\nrecovered from the scene had only Stockley's DNA on it.\nStockley waived his right to a jury trial, allowing the\njudge to decide. He left the St. Louis Metropolitan Police\nDepartment in 2013 and was arrested last year.\nSmith's family settled a lawsuit against the city for\n$900,000 in 2013, Watkins said.\n(Additional reporting
