I have thoroughly enjoyed the privilege and opportunity to represent my country in 46 Tests and the WSB Cape Cobras in 108 first class matches overs the past 16 years,\" the CSA release read.\n\n\"It is an experience that cannot be replaced and one I will always cherish.\n\n\"Test cricket has always been the pinnacle and I've been fortunate enough to experience some memorable highlights with the Proteas and also in first class matches with the WSB Cape Cobras.\n\n\"In recent years I have been privileged to be a senior member and custodian of a special team environment and culture which has made me very proud,\" the statement added.\n\nDuminy, who made his Test debut against Australia in 2008 in Perth, finished with 2103 runs from 46 Tests.\n\nThe 33-year-old, who represents the Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League (IPL) has now decided to focus on the shorter formats of the game.\n\n\"In the years ahead, my focus will be placed on attaining limited overs cricket success for South Africa and the WSB Cape Cobras, along with attending to my young family, who have been incredibly supportive and understanding.\n\n\"I will however not be lost to first class cricket; I have offered my services to the WSB Cape Cobras and the coaching staff as a mentor\/consultant and will be involved as they see fit,\" he said in the statement.\n\n\"There are many talented youngsters coming through our domestic system and I would love to help where I can. I've had the privilege of working with the squad in this role over the last two weeks and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\n\"I certainly know that my playing career is far from over and my hope is that with the backing of Cricket South Africa, WSB Cape Cobras, team mates, family, friends and supporters, I will be given the opportunity to continue to give my very best to the sport that I love dearly,\" he added.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
