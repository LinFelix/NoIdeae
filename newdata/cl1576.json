Jefferson City Schools are also represented.\n\nThroughout the school year, these middle and high school students will meet with Woods to discuss the impact of state policies in the classroom. Members of the Student Advisory Council will also discuss other issues related to education, serve as the Superintendent's ambassadors to their respective schools, and participate in service projects to benefit schools and students.\n\nMembers were selected from a pool of more than 1,500 students who applied to serve on the council. Students were chosen based on the strength of their essay answers, which focused on their ideas for public education as well as their community service experience.\n\nYou can see a list of all the council members on the state Department of Education website.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
