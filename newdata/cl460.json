(http:\/\/bzfd.it\/2x2HX4H)\nThe ads were visible when such keywords were searched for and Google's ad buying platform tracked the ad views, according to the internet media company's report based on the campaign.\nGoogle disabled the keyword searches used in the campaign after BuzzFeed's inquiry, except an exact match for \"blacks destroy everything\", the report said. \n\"We've already turned off these suggestions and any ads that made it through, and will work harder to stop this from happening again,\" Google's senior vice president of ads Sridhar Ramaswamy said in an email. \nThe news comes a day after Facebook Inc said it was temporarily disabling the ability of advertisers to target based on people's self-reported education and job information after a report that those features allowed targeting based on anti-Semitic topics.\n\n\n (Reporting by Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
