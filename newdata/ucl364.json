A curfew was imposed in Abia state where\nthe residence is located.\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group has stepped up\ncalls for secession since its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, was released\non bail in April after being detained nearly two years on\ncharges of criminal conspiracy and belonging to an illegal\nsociety.\nSecessionist sentiment has simmered in the region since the\nBiafra separatist rebellion plunged Africa's most populous\ncountry into a civil war in 1967-70 that killed an estimated one\nmillion people.\nThe military presence in southeastern Nigeria has increased\nin the last few weeks as part of an operation that the military\nsaid was part of efforts to crack down on crime.\n\"The Armed Forces of Nigeria wishes to confirm to the\ngeneral public that IPOB from all intent, plan and purpose as\nanalysed, is a militant terrorist organisation,\" said armed\nforces spokesman John Enenche in an emailed statement.\nThe statement said IPOB had formed a \"Biafra secret service\"\na paramilitary division, extorted money from people on public\nroads and attacked members of the armed forces.\nAn IPOB spokesman was not immediately available for comment.\nThe tension is another security challenge for President\nMuhammadu Buhari in addition to the eight-year Boko Haram\njihadist insurgency in the northeast and attempts to maintain a\nfragile ceasefire in the southern Niger Delta energy hub.\nMilitant attacks on oil facilities in the Niger Delta last\nyear cut crude production by more than a third.\nRenewed calls for Biafran secession prompted Buhari to use\nhis first speech after returning from three months of medical\nleave in Britain in August to say Nigeria's unity was \"not\nnegotiable\".\nAmid mounting tensions in the region, the army on Thursday\nsaid it was investigating video footage circulating on social\nmedia that purportedly showed troops at a checkpoint in Abia\nusing sticks to flog men stripped to the waist and forcing them\nto drink muddy water.\nAmnesty International in 2016 accused Nigeria's security\nforces of killing at least 150 Biafra separatists at peaceful\nrallies. The military and police denied the allegations.\n(Reporting by Camillus Eboh; Additional reporting by Anamesere\nIgboeroteonwu; Writing by Alexis Akwagyiram; editing by
