(An Internet connection and laptop or tablet is all that is needed).\n\nIt is well-known that one of the contributing factors for poor CXC and Common Entrance performance is due to lack of preparation. For many years, parents juggled work and getting children to and from lessons classes. Fortunately, we now live in a world where learning is one click away.\n\nCommitted to promoting academic excellence, Aspyer has developed a suite of online products and services geared toward the enhancement of learning (or education) through interactivity and engagement.\n\nFounded, developed and maintained by a team of Information Communication Technology (ICT) experts and teachers, Aspyer uses a blend of proprietary and open source technology intended to modernise the availability and delivery of educational content and study material (at primary, secondary and tertiary levels) in a manner that is relevant to today's students, sustainable and offers the best chance of success.\n\nThe website, www.aspyer.co, is where the learning happens. Students sign up online to gain access to interactive videos, virtual classrooms, one-on-one tutorials, SBA and homework help, practice exams while tracking their progress in a gamified environment.\n\nAspyer is passionate about students' success and is motivated by the prospects of enhancing education in the Caribbean. We wish all students a productive and successful 2017\/2018 school year.\n\nLog in at www.aspyer.co and let the learning begin.\n\nShare This","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
