(Sept. 12) AP\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nThe blame game\n\nI'm sick!\n\nI just found out there are 7 billion people in the world. What makes me sick is that I don't think I'll live long enough for Hillary to blame each one of them before my time is up!\n\nStanley Rhea, Rancho Mirage\n\nDon't miss this chance\n\nWe have an opportunity to calm the harsh, divisive rhetoric, and allow the legal process to proceed in legalizing the DACA program.\n\nCongress has the constitutional power to enact immigration law. Even President Barack Obama, on several occasions, noted that changing immigration law was beyond presidential powers. Most legal scholars agree with that assessment. Also, Sen. Dianne Feinstein observed that DACA was \"on shaky legal ground ... That's why we need to pass a law, and we should do it.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump recognizes this reality, and has assumed leadership in seeking that Congress enact legislation establishing a permanent resolution regarding the status of some 800,000 \"Dreamers.\"\n\nLet's hope our political leadership in Washington D.C. can achieve a bipartisan solution to this aspect of immigration reform. If not, it will be a tragic missed opportunity.\n\nBruce Nestande, La Quinta\n\nMORE LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\n\nSOUND OFF: How to submit a letter or Valley Voice column\n\nThanks for the group efforts\n\nI applaud the recent news about compromises in the works in Washington (e.g., DACA and border security).\n\nI like to think that I vote for folks who consider compromise to be the heart and soul of governing. Listening, learning, thoughtful consideration and the will to move forward are really what I want in an elected official. I'll look elsewhere for ideologues - perhaps in a house of worship or in the halls of academia.\n\nMeanwhile, kudos go to the Republicans and Democrats who are willing to sit down together and get governing done.\n\nJana Baumann, La Quinta\n\nPrepping a tech savvy infrastructure\n\nKudos to Joe Wallace of CVEP for bringing clarity and candor with respect to the technical qualifications that Amazon has in mind for the selection of its new headquarters (\"Here's all the reasons why the Coachella Valley won't become Amazon's new headquarters,\" by Barrett Newkirk, Sept. 8).\n\nAs much as the Coachella Valley has to offer in the way of great weather, breathtaking beauty and outdoor activities, the fact is, we do not have the infrastructure to support a major technology-based company.\n\nEarning degrees in physics and pursuing a career in engineering enabled me to pursue the better life my parents (a truck mechanic and a secretary) had envisioned for me. However, I had the good fortune to grow up in a Midwestern metropolitan area that provided a fertile environment for pursuing science and technology.\n\nIt would be truly wonderful if young people in our valley had access to what they needed to pursue high-tech careers without having to travel far and wide to do so. The rewards of a STEM career are not just financial; many such careers involve helping humanity, and now more than ever, often need artists as collaborators - an area of endeavor endemic to our valley.\n\nDebra Vogler, Palm Desert\n\nQuestioning the source\n\nIn \"A bad link\" (Sept. 11 letter to the editor), Tom Harris argues that it's a mistake to link extreme weather to global warming. To assure us that he's an expert, he also tells us he is the executive director of the International Climate Science Coalition.\n\nTo argue that climate and weather are not linked is perfect nonsense, of course - the two are as closely intertwined as breathing and oxygen.\n\nMr. Harris' apparent disrespect for learning and denial of scientific fact may set a new standard for that absurd approach to our environment, but that only means he's doing his job. His organization is funded by at least one right wing foundation funded in turn by oil companies and he himself is a former lobbyist and PR consultant for the Canadian petroleum industry.\n\nDavid M. Hamlin, Palm Springs\n\nGender gap at Stagecoach?\n\nIt's a shame more women are not in the Stagecoach lineup, but Garth Brooks' wife, Trisha Yearwood, is no slouch. She is a great singer with a great voice and numerous hits; \"Wrong side of Memphis\" being a personal favorite.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks? Never. They will NEVER recover from that egregious mistake they made. Country music fans hate them.\n\nMartina is great. Dolly is a standing room only star.\n\nYes, bring more women and leave the lesser acts to the bar gigs. This is no place to hunt for the next star.\n\nTom Simmerman, Palm Desert\n\nJudges should be secularists\n\nRe: \"Feinstein is off-base to demand that judges be secularists,\" Sept. 15 column by Michael Gerson\n\nMr. Gerson,\n\nI have two questions for you, and of my neighbors.\n\nDo you believe in the separation of \"church and state\"? Yes or no?\n\nWe are a secular republic. I believe It is very important to discover if a judge will be swayed by a religious doctrine, as opposed to the rule of law. Or would you disagree with that idea?\n\nNo religious group should ever be allowed to dictate to the citizens of these United States. Just look at all the many problems caused in the name of religion, both here in the U.S. and around the world.\n\nPeter M. Hirsch, Palm Springs\n\nShort-term rentals hurt Palm Desert\n\nAs a concerned resident of Palm Desert for 37 years I feel we are being negatively affected by short-term rentals.\n\nThe quality of life for those living next to STR's has diminished and will continue to do so until we stop the rental of residential homes in family neighborhoods for only three days and two nights. This is an illegal commercial enterprise in R1\/R2 neighborhoods and should not be allowed.\n\nWhen people purchase homes in these neighborhoods they do so because the home is in a residential zone. R1\/R-2 zone does not allow commercial enterprises, i.e., mini hotel operations. Gated communities are protected by their bylaws and CCRs but nongated residential neighborhoods must rely on city zoning and ordinances.\n\nPalm Desert City Council should do what is right for its full-time residents who bought here to enjoy the quality of life that our city is known for. At the least short-term rentals should be limited to 30 days minimum with no CUP opportunity, except in those gated R1\/R2 zones.\n\nVan G. Tanner, City Council member 2012-16, Palm Desert\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http:\/\/desert.sn\/2xGpQm2","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
