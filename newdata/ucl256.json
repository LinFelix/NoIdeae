Conor Humphries\nDUBLIN, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Ryanair on Friday\nannounced plans to cancel between 40 and 50 flights per day\nuntil the end of October, disrupting hundreds of thousands of\njourneys, in what it said was a bid to improve its ratio of\non-time flights.\nThe cancellations, which begin immediately, are designed \"to\nimprove its system-wide punctuality which has fallen below 80\npercent in the first two weeks of September,\" Ryanair said in a\nstatement, describing the number of delayed flights as\n\"unacceptable\" to customers.\nIf the airline cancels 40 flights per day for six weeks at a\nload factor of 90 percent, approximately 285,000 journeys would\nbe affected.\nThe Dublin-listed budget airline next week celebrates the\nfourth anniversary of its Always Getting Better campaign, which\nChief Executive Michael O'Leary has described as an effort to\nstop \"unnecessarily pissing people off.\"\nEurope's largest airline by passenger numbers sent emails to\nthe first affected passengers on Friday, giving them the choice\nof a refund or an alternative flight.\nThe airline said it would waive a 40 euro ($48) surcharge\nnormally levied to change flights.\nA Reuters reporter, whose flight from Dublin to Barcelona on\nSept. 18 was cancelled on Friday, was offered a choice of a\nsurcharge of 250 euros to take an earlier flight on Sept. 18 or\n60 euros to take a flight on Sept. 19.\nRyanair said its on-time ratio in recent weeks had been\nimpacted by air traffic control strikes and weather disruptions.\nIt also said it was trying to deal with a backlog of crew leave,\nwhich must be allocated before the end of the year.\nWhile it currently calculates crew leave from April to\nMarch, regulators are forcing it to calculate it from January to\nDecember from the start of next year, it said.\n($1 = 0.8375 euros)\n(Reporting by Conor Humphries, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)\n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2017-09-16
